BODY:
<p>I like to live life on the edge, and helping me to do that is my Mac&#39;s Calendar app with its predliction for silently discarding all alert settings for Google calendar entries. This stresses me out as I&#39;m just waiting for the first time I embarassingly fail to turn up for something. Today, and frankly not for the first time, I set out on a serious Google hunt to find a resolution. I now have one that&#39;s just about tolerable.</p>
<p>It seems the basic problem is that when you modify a Google calendar entry via Calendar, it then immediately syncs back from Google and wipes out any alert that you just configured. But you didn&#39;t want to go to that meeting anyway, right?</p>
<p>I can&#39;t claim original credit for my solution, but I can endeavour to explain it very clearly and add a few extra tidbits. The trick/workaround is to configure Google Calendar itself, via its web UI, to have a default alert for all newly created events. Then it seems that you can modify the alert successfully from within Calendar, to a different number of minutes ahead. However you can&#39;t remove it, so you have to just live with alerts for everything. To me that&#39;s far preferable to none at all.</p>
<p>You can change the setting for Google Calendar as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to your Google calendar at&#0160;<a href="https://www.google.com/calendar" target="_self">https://www.google.com/calendar</a>.</li>
<li>Open the settings page by selecting &quot;Settings&quot; from the gear dropdown in the top right.</li>
<li>Select the &quot;Calendars&quot; tab at the top.</li>
<li>In the list of calendars (which probably only contains your one calendar) select &quot;Reminders and notifications&quot;</li>
<li>In the &quot;Event reminders&quot; section at the top, select &quot;Add a reminder&quot;</li>
<li>Select &quot;Popup&quot; and however many minutes you want, for the default reminder.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t forget to click the Save button at the top left.</li>
</ul>

BODY:
<p>I made a pilgrimage to <a href="http://beershopstalbans.com" target="_self">BEER:shop St Albans</a>, just on the other side of town, to get some interesting beers. Well why not, and it even had the wife&#39;s blessing because she fancied some good beer. The shop&#39;s only been open for three weeks, but it&#39;s very smart and carries a carefully curated collection. Some of it is really rather pricey, and with those prices on stickers at the back of each bottle it was a slightly frustrating experience. I&#39;d see something interesting, pick it up, confirm that it did indeed sound like a cracker, then turn it around to find it was £15. I could have three bottles of wine for the price of that bottle of beer! But in the end I settled on eight to take home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834019b00961dce970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BoBSherunkel" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834019b00961dce970c" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834019b00961dce970c-800wi" title="BoBSherunkel" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>And now, time to sample a couple of them. First up, an extremely local number from <a href="http://bob-brewery.co.uk" target="_self">The private brewery of BoB</a> which is located only about a hundred metres from the shop as it happens. <strong>BoB Sherunkel</strong> is 3.7%, described as a &quot;delightfully dark mild&quot;. And it really is, with a roasted flavour that lingers on the palette, whilst being incredibly easy drinking. Very pleasant.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834019b00a0cbb9970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BoBSlayah" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834019b00a0cbb9970c" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834019b00a0cbb9970c-800wi" title="BoBSlayah" /></a></p>
<p>Next, Bob Slayah, from the same stable, and thought it would appear to be an entirely different beer (5.2%, &quot;premium bitter&quot;) it had overtones of the same roasty flavour, so it followed on nicely.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834019b00a13958970d-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="EpicSaison" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834019b00a13958970d" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834019b00a13958970d-800wi" title="EpicSaison" /></a><br /><br /></p>
<p>And finally, The Wild Beer Co&#39;s Epic Saison, 5% and as crisp, zesty and spicy as the label suggested. Using exotic American hops, it is quite fruity, almost a bit soapy to Mrs C&#39;s tastes. I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to have another one, but it was perfectly pleasant. I also forgot to photograph it post-pouring. Whoops.</p>

<p>I recently got around to repainting the wooden cabin at the end of my garden and chose <a href="http://www.cuprinol.co.uk/products/garden_shades.jsp" target="_self">Cuprinol&#39;s Garden Shades</a> in delightful Seagrass colour. I discovered something rather unexpected however, that others would be well advised to heed before they embark on a similar mission!</p>
<p>This paint is dead clever and develops a waxy surface in order to repel rainwater and protect your wood. Unfortunately, being a water-based paint, this means it may also repel your attempts to apply a second coat! As you can see in my picture above, it&#39;s like painting on glass and the new paint just beads up into globules as it can&#39;t stick to the previous coat.</p>
<p>It distressed me rather when I discovered this phenomenon and a call to Cuprinol followed as soon as I could look up their number. After a bit of a wait a very knowledgable young lady gave me the lowdown on what was going wrong. She recommended I <strong>rub the surface down with methylated spirits</strong> to break down that waxy layer and I&#39;m glad to say that this did indeed do the trick, though it adds a whole lot of extra faff to the process.</p>
<p>I note that on the can it does say &quot;allow 2-8 hours between coats&quot; and with the benefit of hindsight and the explanation from Cuprinol, I see that this is presumably intended as a range with an upper bound. I had left it for a week, and this allowed that waxy surface to develop, so I should have recoated much sooner. However this text is decidely ambigious and can easily be read as a minimum only, stated as a range due to differing drying times according to conditions. It is especially likely that your average reader will interpret it so, as most paint cans provide just a minimum. Interestingly their website states it a bit differently: &quot;Where a second coat is required, allow up to 8 hours in between coats.&quot; It still neglects to explain why this is, the importance of it, and what to do if you are unable to comply.</p>
<p>So be warned that the innocuous statement on the can is actually very important. Sadly this means you have to set aside enough time in one block to coat everything once, allow it to dry sufficiently then recoat. Otherwise you&#39;ll have to get the meths out. Either way this adds a major inconvenience and the cynic in me suspects that&#39;s why they&#39;re reluctant to explain it properly on the can. The nice lady on the phone did say that they get loads of phone calls about this exact problem and are considering how they can improve the instructions. I want to see a very clear explanation of what happens and why, in a big bold box that draws attention. It should also describe the meths workaround. To do anything less is to fail the customer.</p>
<p>FWIW, I&#39;m now very pleased with the results and will use the product again. I would have been so much happier if I hadn&#39;t had to go through this saga, which involved holding on their expensive-from-a-mobile phone line for ages, and a major expedition to find somewhere with meths in stock.</p>

BODY:
<p>Inspired by a random tweet about their added Scala support, I tried out <a href="http://g.codility.com/demo/take-sample-test/" target="_self">the Codility sample test</a>. I rather liked my solution and I think it&#39;s a perfect example of some of the niceties of Scala, in a small way, so here it is:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">def solution(a: Array[Int]): Int = {
    // Partial sums are Longs to avoid Int overflow.
    val sums = a.scanLeft(0L)(_ + _).tail

    def equilibrium(index: Int) = leftSum(index) == rightSum(index)
    def leftSum(index: Int) = if (index == 0) 0 else sums(index - 1)
    def rightSum(index: Int) = sums.last - sums(index)

    (0 until a.length) find (equilibrium(_)) getOrElse(-1)
}</pre>
The use of scanLeft to build up all the partial sums is particularly handy. Having done that it&#39;s very easy to run through all the indexes until we find one that satisfies us. Note that the find method returns an Option[A] so we use getOrElse to return -1 if no solution was found (as per the requirements).

It has a hint of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambic" target="_self">lambic</a> sourness, that makes it fresh and interesting and for me separates it from most other standard brunes. It seems that <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/ciney-brune/5380/" target="_self">many people don&#39;t rate it</a>, but I find it to be an interesting diversion, if only for its subtle sweet and sour novelty. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have more than one of an evening though - it&#39;s not that great overall.</p>

At least if you like that sort of thing. Officially described as being flavoured with red fruits, with a hint of spice and wood, even a touch of sourness, the result is very impressive. Like most fruity beers it&#39;s not strong at 5% but it really does taste wonderful. To me the main fruit flavour is raspberry with maybe a drop of cherry.</p>
<p>I will be seeking out more of this stuff, and if I don&#39;t my wife may not forgive me for drinking most of this one.</p>

My arms having recovered from carrying it home, it&#39;s now time to sample these fine wares.</p>
<p>First up Affligem Blonde, at 6.8% a relative lightweight in the Belgian canon, but I was impressed by the overall result. A bit like Leffe, but more subtle and probably less cloying if you were to drain a few. It&#39;s really smooth and well-balanced, just edging only slightly into the treacly tendencies of classic Belgian brews, but definitely going beyond &quot;straightforward lager&quot;. I really liked it - it&#39;s a great beer to start an evening of lowland delicacies or for general consumption if you&#39;re not feeling like the heavy stuff.</p>
<p>Expect more over the coming weeks, and expect them to be mostly in entirely the wong glasses, as above.</p>

<p>In the world of software development CQRS = Command Query Responsibility Segregation, which in its simplest sense recognises that it&#39;s sometimes better to&#0160;use a different mechanism for reading data than it is for writing it.&#0160;<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html" target="_self">See Martin Fowler&#39;s exposition of the concept</a>&#0160;if you want to know more, but&#0160;this post isn&#39;t actually about software development at all!</p>
<p><strong>I reckon that <strong>we&#39;re at a critical juncture in the evolution of personal computing devices and that&#0160;</strong>the CQRS principle is necessarily coming to the fore to save the human race.</strong></p>
<p>Tablet computers are taking the world by storm, in case you hadn&#39;t noticed. Apple could barely make enough iPad Minis for me to be able to get my wife one for Xmas, though I did manage it at the very last minute, and shortly thereafter bagged one for myself too. Frankly it&#39;s bloody brilliant, but I use it predominantly for consuming rather than creating and I&#39;m far from alone. This is partly because the human populace is inexorably dumbing down towards being fat blobs with brains wired directly into the &#39;net, consuming inane banter, amusing picture of cats&#0160;and the latest celebrity news, 140 characters at a time. But that aside, it&#39;s just not very pleasant to write large quantities of text, manipulate images or perform other expansive creative works by prodding a tiny screen. Or even a big screen.</p>
<p>To write software, construct lengthy blog posts (ahem), edit movies, sequence the human genome or design great buildings requires a proper computer! On that basis I posit that there will always be a place for desktops and laptops, or indeed whatever replaces them but which necessarily has a non-trivial input mechanism.&#0160;I genuinely worry that the market for serious computers will be increasingly neglected by the manufacturers, refocussing as they are on the mass consumer market, inevitably leading to the downfall of humankind. Perhaps I exaggerate - at least I hope so.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve never used Windows 8, indeed I shudder at having to use Windows 7 on a daily basis at work, but I understand it represents something of a chimera. It is best known for its shiny, touchy, slidey &#39;Metro&#39; UI, beckoning your greasy fingers to caress its tiles. However it also allows you to fall back into the more staid world of traditional Windows where presumably you can get some proper work done, as long as you have a keyboard and a pointing device other than your finger. I understand critics are conflicted about this hybrid approach, but it&#39;s CQRS writ large and may therefore be the way forwards. One way or another, at least some people will need to create great works. I do hope to be one of them, and to have the equipment to be able to do it.</p>

<p>I have a fair amount of lawn in my garden, which is looking pretty ropey right now, but I&#39;m working on it! However I&#39;m intending to convert a lot of it to more intriguing beds and paths. This project details one little part of that grand plan. In the picture above, I&#39;ve removed the turf from a corner, which originally had just a narrow bed at the back against the trellis.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8bc6970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BrickPath 3" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8bc6970b" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8bc6970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BrickPath 3" /></a></p>
<p>My plan was to put a curving brick path through this new area, leaving an eye-shaped island that will probably host a small tree and other planting high enough and rumbustious enough to make the path a little voyage of discovery. A very little voyage, but adding much-needed intrigue.</p>
<p>I started by using the garden hose to experiment with the shape of the path, using some bricks to get the width right. What a beautiful shape!</p>
<p>Those bricks, and indeed all the bricks I will use, are from the rear chimney on the house, which was removed in a recent loft conversion (the chimney, not the house). They are a mix of old handmade red clay bricks and nasty moulded modern things, but they have some character, including sooty marks, and I think mixed up they&#39;re going to look the part.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how well they will survive the harsh winters that seem to be the new normal. I strongly suspect&#0160;they will suffer from frost damage and it will be interesting to find out whether it&#39;s the old or new that perform better. I have plenty left to repair the damage. For the record, ideally you&#39;d use engineering bricks, but I don&#39;t have any and I feel it would lack the charm of a crumbling old brick path.</p>

<p>Having established the basic shape and scored a mark in the soil with the edge of a spade along the hosepipe, I dug it out about a brick deep plus a couple of centimetres for the sand. I also added 5cm or so on either side to give room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Theoretically I should use pegs in the ground, string and spirit levels to establish a perfectly level, flat path, but that&#39;s just not my style, and the two ends are not at the same level anyway. I used a couple of bits of straight wood and my eye to make sure that the soil bed was basically level with no major local bumps or hollows. Again I invoke &#39;rustic&#39; as an excuse for my slapdashery.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017d42c9a512970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BrickPath 5" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834017d42c9a512970c" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017d42c9a512970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BrickPath 5" /></a></p>
<p>Do you know why sharp sand is called sharp sand? Because the individual grains are all knobbly and &#39;sharp&#39;, compared to non-sharp sand which has smooth, rounded grains. This helps them to lock together and form a firm base. I&#39;ve used four bags of sharp sand and with the aid of a rake and a piece of wood the width of the path dragged over it, I&#39;ve turned it into a smooth base ready for my bricks. I spent quite a while trying to get this right, as it will be reflected in the final result.</p>
<p>By the way, I bought six bags of sand from Wickes for the grand total of £10.86, and that was my entire spend on this project. The rest is bricks and tools I already had, and my own labour.</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8d13970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BrickPath 1" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8d13970b" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8d13970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BrickPath 1" /></a></p>
<p>I figured it was best to lay one whole run the length of the path, to establish and tweak the basic curve. Then of course the subsequent runs are a bit longer each time around the curve, so we need half-bricks here and there to keep a good pattern going.</p>
<p>I used a bolster chisel and club hammer to cut the bricks by hand, which takes a bit of technique, a certain amount of practise and a lot of patience, especially when it&#39;s raining and you can&#39;t see through your goggles (you don&#39;t want brick chips in your eye). I think most people would find this the most challenging part of the project if they haven&#39;t done it before. You can get machines to do it nicely and with no effort on your part, which would be worthwhile if doing anything much bigger. A straight path would only require half-bricks at the ends of course.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8da1970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BrickPath 6" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8da1970b" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8da1970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BrickPath 6" /></a></p>
<p>Once I&#39;d got all the bricks down it looked pretty good, but only then did I fork over the beds either side, being very careful not to disturb my new path. I had been agonising over whether to do that first or last. I feared that if I did it first I might loosen the firm bed for my path, compacted nicely as it was under the old lawn. Also, it would have made working around the path and seeing the edges a lot harder, so I&#39;m glad I did it this way around.</p>
<p>
<a class="asset-img-link" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8de7970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BrickPath 7" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8de7970b" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834017c389a8de7970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="BrickPath 7" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, I did that digging of the compacted soil, and packed it up to the edge of my bricks, ready to receive plants. Then I brushed more sharp sand into all of the cracks to finish off the path itself. That took a surprisingly long time and a few goes as the bricks settled and new holes opened up. Using very dry sand really helps it to fall down those cracks so I dried mine out in the sun before using it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very pleased with the result, but time will tell whether it&#39;s really any good. Next project is the planting either side of it.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I do love a Belgian beer. I don&#39;t know how they do it, but their strong, sweet creations are the beery equivalent of comfort food to me. But this is a strange creature that I review today.</p>
<p>Bought in the Carrefour Express in Brussels Midi station, it appears to be a slice of Scottishness amid the Belgian fancies, certainly in terms of the branding. But it&#39;s 10% by volume and is quite clearly a deliciously sticky Belgian tipple exactly as I would expect, and decidedly un-Scottish. I suppose Barley wine may be the connection. It&#39;s described on the bottle as &quot;strong blond and mellow beer&quot; and I can&#39;t argue with that.</p>
<p>Is this just a piece of branding silliness, selling a bit of tartan-clad och-aye-the-noo to the rest of the world, who do appear to love that sort of thing? Possibly. But I actually liked it so much that I&#39;d buy it again.</p>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth a little delve into its provenance takes us to anthonymartin.com where we find that an English brewer setled in Belgium and started producing beers in 1909 and that this particular brew has been around since 1990 and they own the TImmermans brewery known for Gueuze Lambics.</p>

Every tangible thing I use, every service I consume, I can&#39;t help but notice all the little things that could have been a bit better. And it really frustrates me when these are details that seem so very simple to fix.</p>
<p>For instance, when I buy a train ticket from FCC&#39;s machines at St Pancras I can&#39;t actually see the text on the card payment screen unless I squat uncomfortably, because it&#39;s low down and inset out of sight. I know it&#39;s low down so disabled/short people can use it, but at least provide a direct line of sight for the average sized person standing in front of the machine - i.e. 95% of your customers!</p>
<p>I recently bought a D-Link powerline networking kit on Amazon, which is a wonderful product by the way, that worked straight out of the box with zero configuration. But the Amazon page did not state that there were two ethernet cables in the box - though I suspected there might be and was explicitly looking for this information. Worse than that, it provided a handy link to buy the product along with two separately supplied ethernet cables. So I went with that (better safe than sorry) but lo and behold: two cables in the box and now I have two extras I paid for and don&#39;t need. I feel I have been poorly served by Amazon.</p>
<p>Often when travelling by train, announcements are made that are inaudible due to the low volume (compared to background noise) or muffled by unhelpful acoustics. But these are sometimes really very important announcements and there&#39;s precious little point making them if they can&#39;t be heard.</p>
<p>Whenever I visit the hairdresser they ask me what I want doing, and I struggle to articulate it, especially when it comes to the intricacies of the back of my head. Why don&#39;t they take photos and notes (in special hairdresser shorthand) so that they can sort me out consistently every time, even when it&#39;s somebody new cutting my hair. As far as I&#39;m concerned this is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>There are many little disappointments just like this that I spot on a daily basis, with physical and virtual products and services and I&#39;m increasingly wondering whether there&#39;s a way to turn this into a job: detail consultant. Available for hire by companies small and large, I would tell them what could be improved to give their customers a delightful rather than frustrating experience. It&#39;s not rocket science but apparently there&#39;s a gap for this sort of common sense supplied from an external viewpoint. Please form an orderly queue!</p>
<p>In fact I&#39;m surprised that larger organisations don&#39;t have full time employee roles with exactly this mandate: roving throughout the company and in the field spotting and fixing these subtle issues. In a competitive world where bad publicity is only a Tweet away, this seems like a very good use of resources to my naive mind. If you have any pride at all in what you&#39;re doing that is.</p>

Justine - well yes and no. Consultants are usually hired to tackle a specific thing, or at least for a specific period, rather than to be permanently looking out for and fixing details to make sure the company is always awesome.

BODY:
<p>I&#39;ve been doing some trivial benchmarking of <a href="http://www.playframework.org/" target="_self">Play 2</a> with ab (<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html" target="_self">Apache Bench</a>) just to get an idea of its raw capabilities for serving simple requests - and because it&#39;s what I always do when picking up a new framework so I know what I&#39;m dealing with. In doing so I ran into a bit of a puzzler that had me thinking Play 2 was bugged - but my spidey sense soon kicked in and told me it was more likely to be an OS or ab issue. I had done approximately the following, using Play 2.0.1 on OS X 10.7.3, and I&#39;m pretty certain you&#39;ll see the same results if you do this on a Mac:</p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&gt; play new hello  [select option 1 - basic Scala app]</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&gt; cd hello</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&gt; play start</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&gt; ab -c 50 -n 16000 http://localhost:9000/  [Runs fine - about 3700rps]</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&gt; ab -c 50 -n 16000 http://localhost:9000/  [Gives up with timeout]</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&gt; ab -c 50 -n 16000 http://localhost:9000/  [Runs fine - about 3700rps]</span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt;">&gt; ab -c 50 -n 16000 http://localhost:9000/  [Gives up with timeout]</span></pre>
<p>It took me a bit of experimentation to establish that it&#39;s about 16000 requests that work fine, followed by timeouts, in a reliable pattern. That&#39;s a suspicious number, being near enough a power of 2, which is what clued me into it being an OS limit that I was running into. I ran the same ab test (with the same result) against the built in Apache https serving a static file, confirming that Play 2 probably wasn&#39;t to blame.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a quick Google turns up the goods. My OS was running out of the approximately 16000 ephemeral ports available and having to wait for them to be released before it could reuse them. So not Play 2 or ab&#39;s fault at all. Actually in some senses it <em>is</em> Play 2&#39;s fault for being so fast that I&#39;ve run into this limit.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not going to go into the details of <a href="http://www.ncftp.com/ncftpd/doc/misc/ephemeral%5Fports.html" target="_self">what ephemeral ports really are</a>, as others have done that perfectly well, and there is a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1217100" target="_self">good StackOverflow answer</a> with some key ways to work around the problem by modifying parameters of the OS&#39; network stack - but be careful and make sure you understand what you&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>However, one very simple way to workaround the issue is to simply pass the -k option to ab, to use HTTP keepalive (assuming the server you&#39;re testing supports it). Note that this changes the nature of your test though, as you&#39;re no longer really simulating large numbers of separate connections - but for basic sanity check testing it may help. For the record `ab -c 50 -n 100000 -k http://localhost:9000/` benchmarked&#0160;Play 2 at about 7000 requests per second on my 2.4GHz Core Duo MacBook.</p>

BODY:
<p>The hype around the&#0160;<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_self">Scala</a>&#0160;programming language just got too much recently and I decided to give it a go. I&#39;m two thirds of the way through&#0160;<a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala" target="_self">Programming in Scala</a>, a massive but very good tome and I&#39;ve been experimenting with the language and tools, though only a little bit so far. I have also just received the newly published&#0160;<a href="http://typesafe.com/resources/scala-for-the-impatient">Scala for the Impatient</a>&#0160;(a deliberately much more compact book) and will be working through that as well.</p>
<p>To put it mildly, Scala is not for the faint hearted, or anyone who just wants to get some stuff done ASAP. There is a big, steep learning curve and the relative immaturity of the language and the small community means you&#39;d better be used to the pains of the bleeding edge. I thought Ruby was hard work, but Scala is frankly more so in my experience so far.</p>
<p>However the language is somewhat addictive - or perhaps I just like the challenge of learning stuff that takes a bit of grokking. It&#39;s a big language, with many very clever facilities and features. It&#39;s mind-boggling to start with but I think it&#39;s starting to sink in. Of course there&#39;s the functional paradigm to understand and master, but I did plenty of that at university so it doesn&#39;t frighten me.</p>
<p>Enough people have written about the&#0160;<a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/scala-sink-or-swim-part-1/">frustrations</a>&#0160;<a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/scala-sink-or-swim-part-2/">and</a>&#0160;<a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/blog/scala-sink-or-swim-part-3/">wonders</a>&#0160;of writing code with Scala, so I think I will reflect on a few miscellaneous findings, mostly of a practical bent.</p>
<h3>Compiler speed</h3>
<p>The Scala compiler is surprisingly slow and it seems to be one of the main bitching points amongst people trying to get up to speed with the language. But seriously, when you&#39;re used to instantaneous results with Grails, or even plain old Java (especially with JRebel) then waiting several seconds even for a trivial app is most upsetting. But I&#39;m trying to be Zen about it.</p>
<p>The mailing lists tend to be full of griping about the compiler&#39;s speed, usually met with promises that it&#39;s getting faster, but the Scala compiler is so much more complicated than the Java compiler that it seems unlikely to do its work in the blink of an eye anytime soon. See&#0160;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/3612212" target="_self">Martin Odersky&#39;s explanation of why it&#39;s slow</a>&#0160;on Stack Overflow.</p>
<h3>Eclipse support</h3>
<p>Eclipse supposedly has good Scala support via the Scala-IDE plugin, but I found the out of box experience so terrible that I have given up. Having created a &quot;new Scala project&quot; I still had to manually add the Scala libraries to the project and manually create run configurations, which would very often still not appear in the lists of ways to run the project. I just want to hit &quot;Go&quot; and for my app to run - it should be trivially easy to make this happen. In my experience the best open source projects are the ones that deliver a delightful out-of-box experience and this has disappointed me on that front.</p>
<h3>IntelliJ IDEA support</h3>
<p>Luckily the Community (i.e. free) edition of IDEA supports Scala. Even though I hadn&#39;t used IntelliJ previously, I figured out how to download their Scala plugin and create a Scala app within just a couple of minutes and it was a very smooth experience compared to installing the Scala support into Eclipse (don&#39;t get me started).</p>
<p>However compilation of a Hello World app took 7 seconds every time I modified the single file! A bit of Googling led me to discover FSC - the Fast Scala Compiler - which is part of the standard Scala toolset. Support for FSC is built-in to IDEA but that support is turned off by default. Once I turned it on for my project things hotted up and compilation took just 2 seconds. That&#39;s still lamentable compared to most other languages, but just about tolerable for now. I have no idea how things go for a big project, though I get the impression from mailing lists that waiting tens of seconds or even minutes for a compile is fairly commonplace. We shall see.</p>
<h3>Play 2.0</h3>
<p>One of the reasons I decided to try Scala in the first place was the fuss over the&#0160;<a href="http://www.playframework.org/" target="_self">Play 2.0 framework</a>, which has just recently been released in its first &#39;complete&#39; form. I have only messed with a couple of tutorials so far and frankly it&#39;s bewildering and strange coming from frameworks like Spring MVC, Grails, and Ramaze (a small Ruby framework).</p>
<p>There is much wailing and gnashing of teeth on the Play mailing list from people upset about its radical new direction, and its emphasis on Scala compared to Play 1. Maybe it&#39;s just the pain of change, but there&#39;s no doubt Play 2 is hard work to get to grips with.</p>
<p>I get the impression that a lot of people are missing the point though - it&#39;s a case of horses for courses. Play 2 is rather exotically architected using cunning non-blocking approaches that require it to abandon the classic Java Servlet container entirely. It also requires you to write obtuse and sometimes verbose code (compared to Grails say - though it&#39;s usually less verbose than Java) and partly because of that non-blocking architecture. Reading and understanding the&#0160;<a href="http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0/ScalaActionsComposition" target="_self">Play 2 docs on Action Composition</a>&#0160;may very well require a PhD, but Action Composition is a technique that must be used to achieve relatively common ends. It&#39;s all a bit overwhelming for newbies.</p>
<p>This clever shenanigans enables it to handle 40,000 requests per second (albeit very very simple requests) using less than 20MB RAM. I saw Guillame Bort demonstrate this at QCon and it&#39;s certainly impressive. The point though is that it&#39;s all architected for the sort of new-breed web app that&#39;s dealing with connected rich-clients rapidly pushing and pulling data. If you want to create a few CRUD pages for a small admin team to look after a database then I very much doubt that Play 2 is for you.</p>

<p>I recently switched from O2 to Three (whilst picking up a new iPhone 4S) and frankly it’s great. It must be great if I&#39;m blogging about it! Key wins are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All you can eat data</strong> with Three. O2 have recently abandoned unlimited data and charge based on fixed price data packages for paltry amounts – e.g. 500MB for £6 per month. To be fair I should point out that their systems told me I was only using about 200MB per month previously. But read on…</li>
<li><strong>Tethering! </strong>I can turn on Personal Hotspot on my iPhone and connect to it via Bluetooth, USB or WiFi from another computer and get all the wonders of the internet. This has revolutionised my train ride to work with my laptop. Phone stays in pocket and via Bluetooth I’m fully connected to the world. This is technically possible on some other networks but often only at a price, either to turn it on at all, or because you’ll be charged oodles for the data you use up.</li>
<li><strong>Raw speed</strong>. Over 3G I now regularly get 8MBit downstream, 1.5MBit upstream. That’s better than many people’s home broadband and a lot better than I ever got with O2.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s not all fun and sunshine though. I found a couple of major downsides, which I will just have to live with.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual voicemail doesn’t exist on Three. </strong>Frankly I was dumb-founded when I noticed this. I literally couldn&#39;t believe it, but apparently it&#39;s true.&#0160;Instead you get a text message telling you that you have a voicemail and then have to phone a voicemail number and painfully navigate through things with the numeric keypad. It’s positively medieval and if I wasn&#39;t so smitten with their data service it would definitely be a reason to avoid Three entirely.<br /><br />Of course you only find this out after you&#39;ve signed up because it&#39;s not something they point out to you. I have had conflicting messages from different Three employees in shops and on the customer service line about whether they ever intend to get with the program here. Alas I fear they won&#39;t.</li>
<li><strong>Customer service can be dodgy.</strong> It was a struggle to get my phone up and running in the first place due to some miscommunication and dodgy information from Three. Their customer service line is like a choose your own adventure book - consisting of endless numeric options designed to avoid having to actually talk to you. Once I actually got to speak to somebody it was alright, though I had to fight my way through the number-maze each time - they wouldn&#39;t give me a direct number.<br /><br />Before my phone was activated (which is ironically what I was trying to phone up to arrange) it was literally impossible to talk to someone because the first auto-question asked for your mobile number and then complained that it wasn&#39;t activated! Apparently you have to type hash to defeat this particular monster but <strong>they didn&#39;t tell me that and the prompt doesn&#39;t mention it</strong>. Apparently it&#39;s a secret.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>

BODY:
<p><strong>Updated 17/3/2011 with a solution to Spring Security redirecting</strong>.</p>
<p>I had a bit of a fight against Grails to get security exceptions handled the way I wanted, but having figured it out I thought I&#39;d write it up. It&#39;s really very simple - I had just had the wrong end of the stick.</p>
<p>I want to be able to throw an org.springframework.security.access.AccessDeniedException from anywhere in my code and have that appear to the user as a custom error page of my design, but with a 403 response code (that&#39;s 403 Forbidden, rather than 500 Internal Server Error) and maintaining the originally requested URL rather than redirecting to an error URL as Spring Security sometimes prefers to do (because then you can&#39;t refresh to retry).</p>
<p>My main confusion arose from the way Grails&#39; UrlMappings.groovy handles custom exception mapping. It turns out that you need to do it like this:</p>
<pre>// Handling specific exceptions requires a 500 code on the left for the
// mapping to pick them up, but we can send back another code in the
// controller that sends back the response.
&quot;500&quot;(controller:&quot;error&quot;, action:&quot;error403&quot;, exception:AccessDeniedException)</pre>
<p>The only surprising thing is that you need a &quot;500&quot; code at the left rather than &quot;403&quot;. The reasoning seems to be that this is the <em>incoming</em> error code to the mapping function, and <em>all</em> exceptions are deemed to represent a 500 error code at this point, i.e. they represent an internal server error, which on reflection isn&#39;t entirely unreasonable. To then send the error back to the user I have an ErrorController and an associated view in /views/error/error403.gsp.</p>
<pre>@Secured([&#39;permitAll&#39;])
class ErrorController {
    def error403 = {
        // Ensure that the correct response code gets sent. If we don&#39;t do
        // this, it may send a 500 (internal server error) response because
        // of the way we had to configure the UrlMappings for handling specific
        // exception types with 500.
        return response.sendError(javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN)
    }
}</pre>
<p>I also figured out how to stop Spring redirecting to a new URL when it decided to deny access. I&#39;d rather the originally requested URL remain in the address bar. The trick is to put the following in Config.groovy.</p>
<pre>grails.plugins.springsecurity.adh.errorPage = null</pre>
<p>The major remaining annoyance is that these exceptions get reported in the logs whereas I&#39;d rather they weren&#39;t (they represent the system working correctly) but I imagine I have to reconfigure logging to resolve that.</p>

There is a bug report to add support for mapping exceptions to response codes: <a href="http://jira.grails.org/browse/GRAILS-5758">http://jira.grails.org/browse/GRAILS-5758</a>  With any luck the new feature will make it into 2.3.

That would let you avoid the interim step of resetting your error code to 403 from 500.

Sorry - I have no idea. I would look at the logger config file and see if you can specify a different log level for the relevant fully qualified class name, or something like that. I haven't used this stuff for a couple of years so I'm guessing.

Well, iPhone camera is not bad, but... this picture is particularly lucky, because the strong (red) color spot is actually situated at the golden ratio. Otherwise I see some chromatic aberration (color error) so iPhone still need to improve.

BODY:
<p>I just upgraded to latest Spock and Geb releases (0.5 and 0.5.1 respectively) but have had to undergo a strange sort of hell of odd errors before getting back on track. Turned out none of these were due to any actual code incompatibilities and eventually (after a couple of hours of fruitless head scratching) I got past them by running &quot;grails clean&quot; (which got me to some new errors) and finally by deleting ~/ivy2/cache. The latter step sadly seems to be required quite often when adding or upgrading plugins.</p>
<p>Personally I&#39;m bitterly disappointed that Ivy (or Maven, if that&#39;s your poison), the so-called solutions to dependency hell, seems to introduce its own dependency nightmare more often than not. Of course every time you delete that Ivy cache folder you have to wait fifteen minutes the next time you run the app, whilst it downloads hundreds of jars. If you&#39;re on the train and not connected to t&#39;Internet, you&#39;re really stuck.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure one day I&#39;ll grok what&#39;s really going on with this stuff, but for now I feel it ought to just work, but it really doesn&#39;t, and many people must waste a lot of time (or give up entirely) as a result.</p>

BODY:
<p>The problem with a lot of industrial design is that it&#39;s cynically conducted to sell the device in the first place, rather than to actually be any good in the long run. That is to say, the device is designed to appeal to the shop-floor browser who&#39;s making a snap judgement between competing products, rather than to actually be a brilliant product for them to use year after year. Once they&#39;ve bought it the game is over as far as the manufacturer is concerned, as long as it doesn&#39;t actually break down, because poor usability does not invoke the warranty! I came across a great example of this recently in the control panel of a Siemens fridge. Behold:</p>
<p><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340133f58913cf970b-pi" style="display: inline;"> <a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340133f589150b970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SiemensFridge" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340133f589150b970b" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340133f589150b970b-800wi" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="SiemensFridge" /></a></a></p>
<p>There is one button on here that you will use several times a day. The rest you may use either never or once every year or two. Care to hazard a guess which one is the magic button of actual usefulness? It&#39;s the one marked &quot;dispenser&quot;. Or to be precise it&#39;s the one marked &quot;dis-penser&quot; split over two lines, such is their lack of grace. This button switches the ice/water dispenser between water, ice and crushed ice. To get a glass of iced water, you have to press it a few times to cycle round the options as you fill your glass with ice, then water.</p>
<p>This should be the only button on the front of the fridge immediately above the dispenser, and it should be very clearly labelled. In fact arguably there should be three buttons, for water, ice and crushed ice, with LEDs to show which one is selected. They should be labelled &quot;Cold water&quot;, &quot;Ice&quot; and &quot;Crushed Ice&quot;. Imagine a visitor to your house approaching your Siemens fridge for a cool drink. They will probably accidentally defrost your freezer then child-lock the fridge before giving up and having tap water. Maybe it&#39;s an eco feature?</p>
<p>The controls that are not related to the water/ice dispenser should be far away from it, possibly inside the fridge door or behind a panel, so as not to pointlessly engender confusion and accidental fridge reconfiguration when trying to get a refreshing beverage.</p>
<p>So why have Siemens chosen to take this insane path? I don&#39;t believe they could be so obviously dumb, so I assume it&#39;s a cynical ploy to sell more fridges. Imagine Joe Shopper, strolling through the aisles of Currys, looking at endless gleaming monoliths of cool technology. Joe wants a high-end fridge, the sort of fridge that says &quot;Joe is a classy guy who won&#39;t let anything stand between him and a glass of brain-freezingly cold water.&quot; Given two stainless steel slabs of Germanic engineering with largely identical specs he&#39;s going to go for the one with the most &#39;impressive&#39; control panel. So actually Joe, it&#39;s your fault, but the nice guys in the Siemens design department must cry themselves to sleep at night.</p>

I object to the first sentence. Whilst some designers are unthinking time servers and careless about the modus operendi of controls most aren't. Thus you can probably trace the cause of this entirely witless example to other causes. Design commonly has to pass through the usual suspect filters of cost, production, commercial inputs, having common parts with other products in the range,the bosses secretary (not kidding very true), parts (inc control panels) sourced from the far east etc. None of these are an excuse for this particular design failure as it would be easy enough to find a much better example ranged alongside in various sales emporiums. It does have something in common with another paragon of Germanic design; much of the VW/Audi range have rows of similarly neat looking buttons which are not always suitable to their function, or as your main point, their relative importance. Are they criticised much? E-type jag was as bad.

Long long ago I recall on taking up a new job that whenever I wrote a document I had to have the vision of a gentleman called Councillor Brain in my mind.  He was a great bloke with many real personal qualities.  Alas, Brain was entirely the wrong surname for him.  His difficulty in that area unluckily was shared by a number of his colleagues.  Critically they had to be able to understand what I was on about and what was involved, otherwise I would would be either on a road to nowhere or they would make entirely the wrong decision just to prove a point.  I do wish designers of very many modern consumer products would have someone in mind who was none techie or had poor sight or who were getting old.

<p style="text-align: left;">I feverishly installed the latest Springsource Tool Suite release today - 2.5 RC1.

<p style="text-align: left;">It became apparent that it does this every time I saved a Groovy file that required my running Grails app to reload. It seems that STS didn&#39;t like the files in the &#39;target&#39; folder changing as it recompiled, especially since I have &#0160;auto-refresh turned on in STS. I worked around this by setting up a rule for my project to exclude the target folder.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Right-click on the project, selected &quot;Properties...&quot; then Resource &gt; Resource Filters. Add a filter to exclude the folder &quot;target&quot;.</p>

Actually I'm still seeing it too, but in fewer circumstances. I imagine there are some other things that need to be excluded, but I haven't figured out what and nothing's leaping out at me. Let me know if you figure it out!

BODY:
<p>I&#39;ve been slowly banging away at a small Grails app on the train to and from work, to teach myself <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a> the language and <a href="http://www.grails.org/" target="_blank">Grails</a> the web framework. I already had a good familiarity with Java, Spring and Hibernate so it is mostly a case of learning what Groovy and Grails add on top of those. I&#39;ve still got a long way to go, but I thought it worth jotting down some thoughts in case they help somebody else work their way into this particular world.</p><p>Overall, it&#39;s been fairly pleasant and I&#39;m optimistic that it&#39;s probably as good a way to go about your average web app as any I&#39;ve found before, and I&#39;ve tried plenty over the past decade, including a few fairly obscure ones. I should point out that I don&#39;t believe in silver bullets any more. There are always going to be frustrations along the way when using any technology for a non-trivial project involving real-world customer requirements, but it&#39;s instructive to see just how many of those frustrations there are, and how hard they are to get past. I&#39;m pleased to say that each time I&#39;ve got a bit stuck with Grails I&#39;ve been able to dig myself out fairly swiftly with the help of the existing documentation, other web resources, the #grails channel on freenode IRC and the grails-user mailing list. Furthermore, the principle of least surprise (POLS) is alive and well, meaning that when I hope that I&#39;d find a particular feature to solve my problem du jour, it&#39;s usually there for me to find.</p><p>It&#39;s not all sunshine and roses though. For instance when I upgraded to Grails 1.3.3 my unit tests started failing with a strange and unhelpful stack trace emanating deep from within the guts of the plugin framework. Turns out this is a bug introduced in 1.3.3 that plenty of people have been caught out by. I&#39;ve had to go back to 1.3.2 for now. It&#39;s a shade surprising and disappointing that a release could contain a bug like this, and that it&#39;s not been fixed and re-released yet. I worry that people trying Grails out for the first time with 1.3.3 will have a bad experience and give up early because of issues like this.</p><p>I had a struggle to find half decent tools. I&#39;ve been a huge fan of Netbeans over the past several years and it claims to have great Groovy and Grails support, but I found it to be woeful I&#39;m afraid. Common GSP tags completely confused the GSP editor (it claims the syntax is wrong) so I struggle to believe that those claiming it has this great support have actually tried developing a non-toy Grails app with it. I&#39;ve settled on SpringSource Tool Suite (a bastardised Eclipse) which isn&#39;t bad - though as of this writing you definitely want to get the 2.3.3 M2 version for the latest Groovy and Grails support that&#39;s not yet in the stable release.</p>

Keep it up. And please keep posting about your experiences. Posts about new grails development projects are always interesting to me.

The bug you talk about it's now fixed in version 1.3.4. But it was really annoying.

BODY:
<p>I&#39;m currently getting to grips with Groovy and Grails. One major frustration that took a while to figure out was HTML escaping in GSP pages. Here&#39;s the simple lowdown, including at the end the important bit that I had struggled to realise, which is how to <strong><em>not</em></strong> escape specific strings when global HTML escaping is turned on.</p>

<h3>Manual escaping</h3>

<p>Out of the box (i.e. with a vanilla Grails app with default config) you need to explicitly escape any dangerous strings with the encodeAsHTML() function that Grails makes available on all Strings: ${dangerString.encodeAsHTML()}. This is a bit verbose, but at least it&#39;s very clear, and because it&#39;s just a method on String it&#39;s available everywhere in your app, not just in GSPs.</p>

<h3>Auto-escaping with default codec</h3>

<p>If you modify Config.groovy to contain&#0160;grails.views.default.codec = &quot;html&quot; (which is there by default and set to &quot;none&quot;) then it automatically calls encodeAsHTML() for you whenever you use ${} in GSPs. This is clearly quite a handy option and a much safer way of configuring things as it lessens the likelihood of slipping up and leaving a hole in your app.</p>

<h3>Overriding auto-escaping per item</h3>

<p>So far this is all exactly as per <a href="http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/single.html#11.2%20Encoding%20and%20Decoding%20Objects" target="_blank">the Grails docs</a> (which go into much more detail on codecs and what&#39;s really going on, including creating your own) but the crucial bit they fail to mention is what to do if you&#39;ve turned on the global html codec, but have situations where you don&#39;t want escaping. The answer is to simply use the alternative JSP style interpolation syntax &lt;%=mySafeHTMLString%&gt; since the codec is only applied to ${}.</p>

<h3>Overriding auto-escaping per page</h3>
<p>You can also set the codec on a per-page basis, overriding that set in Config.groovy, with&#0160;&lt;%@page defaultCodec=&quot;html&quot; %&gt; or&#0160;&lt;%@page defaultCodec=&quot;none&quot; %&gt; as appropriate.</p>

fieldvalue really is only useful with GORM. If you have inputs from files or API'sor other sources you are trying to use, this isn't very useful.

<p>It&#39;s been a while - sorry about that. I&#39;ve been posting very nearly every day on my other site <a href="http://www.uknatureblog.com" target="_blank">UKNatureBlog</a> so check that out for wildlife including lots from my own garden.</p><p>I&#39;ve also been busy preparing for the imminent arrival of my first child, which is exciting and already life-changing. For instance I&#39;ve now joined my wife in not drinking alcohol as I may be required to rush her off to hospital at a moment&#39;s notice. Hence I have entered the murky world of low alcohol beer! So far we&#39;ve sampled Becks Blue (zero alcohol), Cobra Zero (zero alcohol) and Clausthaler Classic (&lt; 0.5% alcohol). And I must say that Clausthaler has been a revelation that wins out over the others. It doesn&#39;t taste watery and overly bitter (like the Becks) but it&#39;s not cloying and overly malty (like the Cobra). In fact it actually tastes like a fairly normal weakish French bottled lager to me, which is a fair feat when it leaves your head clear. I know it&#39;s German but it reminds me of Kronenbourg or St Omer in stubbies when camping in France for some reason.</p><p>Actually it&#39;s truly quite wondrous stuff as you can savour a cold beer or two on a summer&#39;s afternoon and not be in the slightest bit muddled or woozy for the rest of the day. It&#39;s just refreshing, tasty and beery. I picked it up in Waitrose on a whim, but I now know that it&#39;s actually the most popular alcohol-free brand in Europe and I can see why.</p><p>I learnt a lot about it from this <a href="http://www.ciao.co.uk/Clausthaler_Bottled_Low_Alcohol_Lager__Review_5556039" target="_blank">very good and fact-filled review</a>&#0160;by a beer-craving pregnant lady, a few notables from which I&#39;ll expound upon here. Apparently they brew it in the same manner as other German purity-law beers, but with a special yeast that doesn&#39;t generate nearly so much alcohol. This sets it apart from most other low alcohol brews that pass normal strength beer through an osmosis process that knackers the flavour. Clausthaler claim that the small amount of alcohol in their beer is just enough to make it properly &#39;beery&#39; compared to those with none. Anyway - Clausthaler is thoroughly recommended, though I&#39;m still hoping to find some low-alcohol bitter in the supermarkets. The 30p a can <a href="http://www.mysupermarket.co.uk/tesco-price-comparison/Beer/Tesco_Value_Bitter_21_4x440ml.html" target="_blank">2% generic value bitter</a> you see in the low-end supermarkets doesn&#39;t count as the alcohol content is clearly just the result of penny-pinching.</p><p><br /></p>&#0160;

There are great non alcohol or very low alcohol beers all over Europe. It's just England which seems to produce truly awful ones. Clausthaler is nice, but I also recommend some of the Hungarian brands (Soproni, Borsodi), also Buckler, SchlossGold and in Spain the San Miguel san alcool is good.

Waitrose sell it - or order it from Ocado if you do your super-market shopping with them.

It seemed to come within a few tens of feet of touching down before wisely thinking better of it. There are lots of greenhouses, poly-tunnels, huts, etc. not to mention a row of houses on the other side.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if the pilot was seriously considering landing there, as it seems like a really poor spot that would have ended in disaster. You might get the basket down safely if you were lucky but the balloon envelope would be a nightmare to deal with amongst the allotments. Perhaps as dusk drew in on a fairly still night the pilot was getting a bit nervous about losing light and further opportunities. Or maybe it was just for fun, buzzing low over the houses. It rose quickly with a big burst of flame and then headed off to the fields just North of St Albans where I think it must have landed.</p>

Yes he probably was thinking of landing there.  As dusk approaches your options are limited.  But as he got nearer he would be able to see what you know are there, the poly tunnels etc.  The houses look far enough away not to have been a problem.  And when he decided to abort the landing he would climb out quickly, to get into the higher faster winds.  For someone not claiming to be an expert you've pretty well got it right, except for your "near miss" title!  How do I know?  I've been a balloon pilot close to 40 years........

Thanks for the comment David. I did expect that the pilot was in complete control and able to shoot back up fairly quickly, but I was still surprised that he even contemplated landing there as it's not that big a target to hit and full of stuff that would be damaged, even the balloon itself would be OK.

BODY:
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">I&#39;ve spent the past couple of weeks reading up on <a href="http://www.grails.org/" target="_blank">Grails</a>, a web application framework inspired by Ruby on Rails. It takes advantage of <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/" target="_blank">Groovy</a>, a dynamic programming language that runs on the JVM and is best described as a cross between Java and Ruby. Groovy has support for most existing Java syntax, but also a lot of Ruby-style syntax and dynamic features. To be honest I find that the Java aspects of Groovy (and Grails) drag the whole experience down a bit compared to writing Ruby, but it should be significantly nicer to work with than pure Java.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">The big selling point of Groovy and Grails over Ruby on Rails comes from the compatibility with the whole Java ecosystem. You can have your clever dynamic language without giving up the Java libraries and deployment environments that your projects and customers may demand. This is clearly quite a compelling idea if like me you&#39;ve got a long history of doing big Java web apps but have recently been converted to the dynamic cause.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">One thing that is very important to realise is that Grails is not a port of Rails. It is in fact built on top of the Spring stack, including Spring MVC, REST support, dependency injection, transactionality and Hibernate amongst others. If you&#39;re already familiar with Spring this is probably a good thing, though I do worry that the framework on top of framework approach could lead to having more to learn (and mess up) overall.</p>
<h2>Practical findings</h2>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">My initial experiments showed an interesting result that rather worried me. I set up a domain class and a controller with <em>def scaffold = true</em> to provide built-in CRUD for my domain class. However the CRUD pages this presented were noticeably sluggish in the browser and benchmarking confirmed it could only manage about 2 requests per second. This is lamentably poor and even now I can&#39;t figure out how it&#39;s managing to spend so much time achieving not very much.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">After a bit of experimentation I determined that if I use <em>grails generate-all</em> to put the scaffolding code in place in my classes (rather than using the dynamic scaffolding) then things speed up enormously. In fact I can now get about 200 requests per second. It&#39;s hard to see how there can be such a massive performance gulf between the two scenarios as I would have thought that the only extra overhead for dynamic scaffolding is the initial dynamic intercept of the missing action method and calling into the scaffolding code. Hopefully a Grails expert can explain this, or I will eventually figure it out myself. At least now I have determined that for real-world scenarios there isn&#39;t going to be a performance issue, though I am surprised that the Grails docs don&#39;t have a massive &quot;Warning - dynamic scaffolding is really slow&quot; box.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">For now I haven&#39;t done much but read the docs and try a few things. I hope to get deeper into it soon.</p>

Remember if you run Grails in development mode (grails run-app) it will be slow, since it doesn't cache anything and performs file / class modification checks. To benchmark Grails create a WAR and deploy it onto your container of choice.

Yes, I was aware of that and was generally using 'grails prod run-app' for these benchmarks. I also tried building a war and deploying that, but the performance was still extremely poor for dynamic scaffolding. It's not a problem - I'm just intrigued to know why it is so.

Graeme, I was wondering if you could help I have to demonstrate tommorrow why grails is appropriate for an application to develop , the trouble i have come across is getting column names from syscolumns with a domain class and controller , which is fine but then on the same page I need the actual data for the table_name in syscolumns that a user choose.
So:
If a user selected a COUNTRY table as a static table I get all the column headers and display them in a list action and iterate in the list page to get all the column heading. I now need to get the data back for the first five rows for those headings and have full CRUD, any ideas?

An excuse to gorge to excess on rich food and drink, and an opportunity to slip extras into the supermarket trolley without the wife putting them back on the shelf! Hence a big tube of Minstrels was craftily snuck amongst the shopping and made it through the till and home. Mmmmm Minstrels.</p><p>However glee turned to disappointment when opening the tube to find that it wasn&#39;t rammed full of giant brown Smarties, but instead contained three plastic bags of Minstrels. Bah! I emptied out the bags into the tube, which was then not quite half full. A complete swizz if you ask me. They&#39;ve cunningly put them in bags so the tube doesn&#39;t rattle to give away the short-filling. I imagine I&#39;m not the only shopper who assumed the tube was full but was disappointed, and I am willing to go out on a limb and suggest that the good people at Mars/Galaxy did this cynically to con the good British public. Even if it wasn&#39;t deliberate (and I bet they&#39;ve got an &#39;official&#39; reason for using the bags) I suspect they were perfectly aware of the fact that they were selling half the amount of chocolate that the buyer would intuitively assume. Grrrr.</p>

BODY:
<p>Living as I do in a 1920s house with solid brick walls (no cavity, no insulation) the recent cold snap made it really clear just what a difference insulation makes. The modern flat I was in previously was bordered on most sides by other flats, and its exterior walls were no doubt well insulated. The heating didn&#39;t have to work very hard, but in the new house it had a struggle on its hands and ran nearly continuously through the freezing weather, whilst only very slowly raising the internal temperature. You could almost feel the heat (and the money, and my eco credentials) draining away through those cold solid walls.</p><p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834012876209ae7970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SlabInsulation" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834012876209ae7970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834012876209ae7970c-800wi" title="SlabInsulation" /></a></p></p><p>I&#39;ve been on a mission to improve the odds in my favour since I moved in, having done the following.</p><p><ul>
<li>Improve sealing around the front door, which was quite draughty, by adding self-adhesive strips of V-profile sealant tape. Did the same for a draughty window.</li>
<li>Improve sealing around the back UPVC doors by adding shims to the closing mechanism&#0160;and adjusting the locking system&#0160;to get it to close more tightly and cut out the draught.</li>
<li>Put some clear tape (literally just ordinary Sellotape) on the frame of a UPVC window that was allowing a tiny draught. This wasn&#39;t the gap between window and frame but an imperceptible gap in the frame itself!</li>
<li>Installed secondary double glazing on the few single glazed windows in the house. This is a clear film that you stick up on the inside with double sided tape then shrink smooth with a hairdryer. The air gap that you trap acts just the same as normal double glazing and is not immediately noticeable.</li>
<li>Improved loft insulation by adding 150mm <a href="http://www.space-insulation.com/blanket.html" target="_blank">space blankets</a> in most of the eaves. These are great - easy to handle because they&#39;re wrapped in thin plastic and crazy cheap at most hardware stores because they&#39;re heavily subsidised. I had to be careful not to lay them over wires though (they might overheat) which is tricky as most of the rooms below have a light in the middle of them and hence wires going to those lights from the loft. I&#39;d love to know how everyone else solves this wiry problem, given pretty much everyone must have it.</li>
<li>Added 50mm slab insulation (glass fibre insulation bought in flat semi-rigid slabs, rather than in rolls) to the backs of the plasterboard walls in the converted loft. This stuff is great as you just cut it with a knife to slightly larger than the size required and jam it into the spaces, where it stays. I got a single pack from <a href="http://www.wickes.co.uk/General-Purpose-Insulation-Slab/invt/161197" target="_blank">Wickes</a>, which covers over 7 square metres and only cost me £15 because the pack was damaged and they gave me a discount. I reckon that&#39;s £15 well spent and I hope it will make the loft noticeably warmer. The pictures show this stuff being cut (above) and installed (below) with the left-most bit of wall still to do, showing just the shiny back of the plasterboard - so you can see before and after in one shot.</li>
</ul>

Insulation is imperative to keep homes at comfortable temperatures without wasting money on heating and air conditioning and wasting non-renewable energy sources. Like many other home improvement projects, there are several approaches and materials available and it is important to choose the best option for your situation.

Very good steps taken here. With the loft out of the way are you going to be moving onto the solid walls of the main house now? You can get both internal and external insulation solutions for these kinds of walls but they tend to be quite costly. Unfortunately it's not much of a DIY job.

Actually I've since had a loft conversion so all that hard work of mine ended up in a skip, but on the plus side the loft/roof is now very well insulated indeed with proper stuff.

BODY:
<p>I like a bit of chocolate, but my peanut allergy means I have to read the labels very carefully. One major annoyance is when I find the text &quot;may contain nuts&quot; or similar. The dilemma I face is that peanuts are not technically nuts - they are a legume, more like actual peas than nuts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut" target="_blank">Honest, it&#39;s true</a>. So, when I read &quot;may contain nuts&quot; does the manufacturer appreciate this distinction (in which case I am safe) or are they including peanuts as nuts, as the common man on the street would most likely expect (in which case I am not safe)?</p><p>I asked Cadbury what their position on this is. Here&#39;s what I sent them:</p><p><em><span style="color: #7f007f; "><span style="color: #3b5738; ">As anyone in your industry likely knows, peanuts are not technically nuts - they are a legume. Can you clarify whether Cadbury labelling (e.g. on Cadbury Clusters) that says &quot;May contain nuts&quot; &#0160;includes peanuts in its remit or not? On a technicality I would think not and that I (as a peanut allergy sufferer) could eat the product with impunity. However it might be that you interpret &quot;nuts&quot; to include peanuts. Some companies specifically say &quot;tree nuts&quot; to be clear when they means nuts but not peanuts. I&#39;m keen to understand Cadbury&#39;s position here so I know what&#39;s safe to eat and what&#39;s not. Thanks in advance. Either way, it would be helpful to all nut and peanut allergy sufferers if the labelling could be made unambiguous and I&#39;d appreciate a comment on that more generally.</span></span></em></p><p><font color="#7F007F"><span style="color: #111111; ">The response from Cadbury (over a month later, after me chasing them):</span></font></p><p><font color="#7F007F"><span style="color: #111111; "></span><em>Thanks for your email</em></font></p><p><font color="#7F007F"><em>Our Technical area advise&#0160;Cadbury labels Nuts when referring to Tree nuts. We would label Peanuts&#0160;separately as they are not a Tree nut as correctly pointed out.</em></font></p><p><font color="#7F007F"><span style="color: #111111; ">So, there&#39;s your answer, for Cadbury at least. It&#39;s a shame they didn&#39;t see fit to comment on perhaps using &quot;tree nuts&quot; in their labelling in order to be unambiguous.</span></font></p>

BODY:
<p>Our kitchen had one patch of bare wall but nowhere to put cookbooks other than in a pile on a worktop. A perfect opportunity for some bookshelves! I planned a custom construction made from pine, comprising two uprights resting on the floor with four cross pieces (for three shelves and a top) with the whole thing screwed to the wall for rock solidness.</p>

<p><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834012875ba0616970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="float: right; padding-left:15px; padding-bottom: 10px;"><img alt="KitchenShelves" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834012875ba0616970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834012875ba0616970c-200wi" style="width: 200px; margin: 0px 0px 5px 5px;" /></a></p>

<p>I originally expected to use 18mm thick sawn pine timber, but in B&amp;Q it was clear that these were actually quite warped end to end - the top of a 2.4m plank was about 30 degrees twisted compared to the bottom so that it would have messed up the result something chronic. Instead I bought pine &quot;furniture board&quot; which is engineered from multiple pieces of pine glued together (edge to edge, not ply) which gives a much less lively result with hardly any warp whilst looking quite attractive. It&#39;s quite a lot more expensive mind you, and having waited 30 minutes for the timber cutting service to re-open after lunch I was told my 20cm wide boards were not suitable for the machine. At 2.4m long they weren&#39;t going to fit in the car so a hasty re-planning was required, resulting in the purchase of a number of smaller 25cm wide pre-cut pieces. I&#39;m glad I went for that width actually as many of the books are 22cm and there&#39;s room to accommodate that depth from the wall even though I was worried there wouldn&#39;t be.</p>

<p>I had been keen to get all the lengths cut in store for a perfectly square, straight cut with identical lengths for all the shelves. I don&#39;t have a table saw so I was going to struggle to do this easily myself, but I was forced to saw the boards down to the right length with a hand saw. It was tough to get a good result here and to get them all the exact same length, but the flex in the uprights accommodated the differences. I simply put two number 8 screws into the end of each shelf to hold it in place, with carefully drilled countersunk screw holes, and that seems to have done the job. The countersink bit I bought recently is a godsend - it really makes the results look so much more professional.</p>

<p>A couple of simple metal angle brackets off the peg from B&amp;Q allowed me to screw the whole ensemble firmly to the wall and it really is very rigid. Also note in the picture (click for bigger version) the 45 degree cut off on the tops of the side pieces and the cut-outs at the bottom to allow it to sit flush against the wall above the skirting.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m extremely pleased with the result apart from one thing. I slightly lost track of of the height of my biggest books between start and end of the project, the result being that they don&#39;t quite fit on the shelves by a few millimetres. I&#39;m kicking myself about this, but I&#39;m a novice and I&#39;ll learn from these mistakes.</p>

I came to this blog because of a post you wrote about Apache Bench mark, and have been on it for about an hour. I am slightly frustrated because of the high quality of the content but the lack of an overall theme.  When I visit again please try to sell me something so that I can feel comfortable this blog has a purpose and I am not just stuck inside of someones head.

Also please move the single post in the religion category to design or travel.  Thank you.

Imagine no religion category - it's easy if you try. In fact you don't have to imagine because I've deleted it. Good idea.

What's the purpose of this blog? To give me an outlet for writing about stuff and putting interesting photos online. There's a list of books in the right-hand menu that you can buy if you really want me to sell you something :-)

At least you had a good idea on how to install your kitchen shelves without removing the skirting board. Your shelf looks beautiful as you lean it on the wall with skirting board. I commend you for that idea. So nice to see.

I'm most impressed, I've been meaning to plant a vine for ages now.  From what I gather, keeping it from taking over the garden is the hard bit. I'm also guessing that now wouldn't be the best time to drop a link to Bob Flowerdew's recommended grape varieties for the British climate :)

I shall studiously ignore Bob Flowerdew's thoughts, and simply hope that if he were to rewrite them today then climate change would mean a totally different recommendation.

BODY:
<p>I&#39;ve been having a lot of trouble with my Ruby 1.9.1 install on Mac OS X. Mostly it works fine, but I struggle when installing gems that require native extensions. I think this is because the way my install was built causes linkage problems, perhaps due to 32 vs 64 bit issues, or due to linkage with other libraries. I&#39;m not entirely sure what&#39;s causing the problems, but recently I decided enough was enough and tried out <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/" target="_blank">rvm</a>&#0160;since I&#39;ve heard a lot of good things about it. I got the impression that by compiling from my own source I was stubbornly making a lot of my own trouble.</p>

<p>Rvm is trivial to install: it&#39;s a gem that installs some of its own executables. I did hack my PATH first, to remove&#0160;/usr/local/bin (where my custom Ruby lived) so that I&#39;d be using the stock Mac OS X Ruby for the rvm install.</p>

<p></p>

<p>&gt; sudo gem install rvm<br />&gt; rvm-install</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that rvm-install added the following to the end of ~/.bash_profile automatically, so I could ignore the instruction it gave me about adding it myself:</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">if [ -s ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm ] ; then source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm ; fi</span></p>

<p>I then used rvm to install a fresh version of Ruby 1.9.1:
&gt;&gt; rvm install 1.9.1</p>

<p>Actually that failed with an error about libsqlite3.dylib being the wrong architecture - perhaps another hangover from my old manual installs, or a problem I&#39;m going to have to solve sometime in the future! For now I moved the old version of that file and tried again:</p>
<p>&gt; sudo mv /usr/local/lib/libsqlite3.dylib /usr/local/lib/libsqlite3.dylibOLD<br />&gt; rvm install 1.9.1</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p>

<p>And that left me with a decent ruby 1.9.1 install. Which brought me back to one of the things that I was originally frustrated by: getting NetBeans Ruby debugging working with the fast debugger. With my old install the ruby-debug-ide gem would not install, but I&#39;m pleased to report that it does with this new setup.</p>
<p>However getting NetBeans to actually use my new rvm ruby required a bit of a trick. The Ruby Platform management GUI in NetBeans doesn&#39;t show you hidden folders in its file picker, so you can&#39;t navigate to the ~/.rvm/ruby-1.9.1-p243/bin/ruby file that it wants. The trick is to create a non-hidden symlink, so you can then find it from NetBeans (and it&#39;s also handy to get at your rvm files from Finder):</p>

<p>&gt; ln -s ~/.rvm ~/rvm</p>

<p>One word of warning: once you&#39;re using an RVM Ruby install, <strong>do not use sudo for gem installs</strong>, as the gems (and every part of rvm) live in ~/.rvm so sudo is not required. In fact using sudo will knacker your gems quite badly as it gets its PATH wrong and its permissions and you end up deleting a bunch of stuff to get back to a known good state. I learnt this the hard way!</p>

It looks like the "solution" for this in 10.6 is currently:

sudo ln -s /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/lib/libsqlite3.0.dylib /usr/local/lib/libsqlite3.dylib

BODY:
<p>We had a particular space to fill next to the sofa in our new house, and wanted a low sideboard to house our extensive and exotic booze collection, which up until now has been gathering dust on the floor in a corner. However the space is only 82cm wide and most pieces of suitable furniture we've seen are at least a metre wide, and often too tall compared to the 69cm high sofa.</p>

<p>We set off on Saturday with a medium length list of places to try in our grim search for just the right solution, but we struck lucky at our first stop: <a href="http://www.emmaus.org.uk/" target="_blank">Emmaus</a> in St Albans. This place is basically a second hand furniture shop with fairly rapid turnover, but it's more than just that, being run as a community to get homeless people back on their feet. We've been a couple of times before and not found anything for us, but this time round for <strong>just £10</strong> we came away with an 84 cm wide cupboard that sits just perfectly in our previously empty space.</p>

<p><p style="text-align: center;"><a style="display: inline;" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5f2c692970b-pi"><img  class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a5f2c692970b " alt="EmmausCupboard" title="EmmausCupboard" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5f2c692970b-800wi" border="0" /></a>&nbsp;</p></p>

<p>Isn't that 2cm too wide you may ask? Yes, so I had to remove the beading at the edge of the laminate floor to make enough room for a very snug fit.</p>

<p>Our collection of exotic and nauseous booze will now reside within, perhaps lying undisturbed for decades until young teenagers nick it late at night. And so the cycle repeats.</p>

<p>I went exploring on Hampstead Heath over lunchtime the other day, looking for wild things to photograph (<a href="http://www.uknatureblog.com" target="_blank" title="UKNatureBlog">see UKNatureBlog for the results</a>). From the top of Parliament Hill I took this photograph looking back towards Canary Wharf and my work office in the nearer foreground.

<p>I was very excited to see <a href="http://www.macruby.org/blog/2009/10/07/macruby05b1.html" target="_blank">MacRuby 0.5 beta 1</a> had been announced, complete with ahead of time compilation via LLVM. It has been long while since the previous update on the MacRuby blog in March, but clearly a lot of work has been taking place. At the moment this beta shows the promise of things to come but isn&#39;t yet fit for much more than anticipatory experimentation. If you want to try the macrubyc compiler, <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2009/10/08/getting-macrubys-compiler-to-work/" target="_blank">Antonio Cangiano&#39;s blog post on the topic</a> is a must-read.</p><p>The MacRuby notes suggest that compiled ahead of time or not, it uses LLVM for a big speed win, but my own quick experiment showed the macruby interpreter to be about 3 times slower than the standard MRI Ruby 1.9.1. This was with a single small benchmark app only though, just to prove things were working, so I can&#39;t draw conclusions. I can&#39;t pretend I wasn&#39;t a little disappointed not to see MRI blown out of the water though, even though I know it&#39;s unscientific and wrong of me!</p><p>I couldn&#39;t get a fully compiled version to produce any output, though it appeared to run without barfing, so I couldn&#39;t tell if it was really working or not. It was notable that the compiled binary was nearly 15MB so there must be a lot of statically linked code being included to swell my couple of KB of Ruby code so much. I&#39;m hopeful that this can be improved in the future in order to support my dream of iPhone apps being written with Ruby hooking into Cocoa. In fact more than a dream - I&#39;m hopeful and optimistic that in the long-run Apple will make Ruby a heavily promoted first class citizen for Mac and iPhone development, sitting on top of Objective-C but hiding it for the most part. The whole world has moved on from primitive C-based languages to higher levels of abstraction and I think Apple really needs a successor to Objective-C within the next 5 years. Is MacRuby it?</p>

BODY:
<p>One of the sheds I inherited when I moved into the new house had a bit of a dodgy roof, with the felt rather ragged and exposing the wood around the edges. In the recent strong winds half of the felt actually peeled back and flopped to one side like a bad combover, so with lots of rain forecast for this week I figured I had to act swiftly to keep things dry.</p>

<p>According to their website Homebase don&#39;t actually sell roof felt (though they do sell the nails) so it was Wickes that sorted me out: £11 for an 8 metre roll of felt and a couple of quid more for a ridiculous quantity of &#39;galvanised 13mm extra large head clout nails&#39;. A bargain surely.</p>

<p></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a616e6e4970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ShedRoof1" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a616e6e4970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a616e6e4970c-800wi" title="ShedRoof1" /></a>&#0160;</p> <p></p>

<p>It turned out to be surprisingly straightforward to get the old felt off and the new stuff on, even with no access to the side and rear aspects. I was done within just a couple of hours. I had to do most of the work from perching on the roof itself, which was only just robust enough to support me. The special nails are a joy to work with: push them into the felt with a thumb and they stand up on their own, then two whacks with a hammer and they&#39;re in. Very satisfying.</p><p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a616e76d970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ShedRoof2" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a616e76d970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a616e76d970c-800wi" title="ShedRoof2" /></a>&#0160;</p></p><p>The only thing that went wrong was a misdirected hammer blow when leant over the rear, fighting amongst tree branches, which ripped a hole in the felt. I was nearly done at this point so wasn&#39;t keen to rip it all off and start again, but luckily the tarry felt could be pudged back together with a thumb in such a way that it&#39;s probably sufficiently waterproof. I&#39;ll have to keep an eye on that. It was also tough not to damage the felt when climbing all over it, which explains the scuff marks in the photo below.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a616e7e1970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ShedRoof3" border="0" class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a616e7e1970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a616e7e1970c-800wi" title="ShedRoof3" /></a> <br /> </p>

So what happened after you corrected the misdirected hammer blow? Good thing you didn't hammer your hands. :) You should've thought of asking help from the experts. Every roofing company has ways of correcting those problems.

I think it doesn't have any leaks, Mrs C. I can tell from how you installed the tarry felt firmly, covering the whole roof. But I think we won’t be able to prove it until “favorable” weather conditions prevail (read: heavy rains accompanied by strong winds). It's been 3 years since then. Has there been any heavy rainfall in your community within those years?

@ Sam Carr. It's a good thing that your shed remains dry after every rainfall. It only shows that Mrs C's effort in making the shed is definitely worth it. It's nice to know that there weren't any problems on your shed after all these years. But still make sure to check on it, okay?

Great job with the roof! The shed certainly looks better now with its new roof. When it comes to materials, there are many options when building a shed roof. Finding the best one for your shed may take up some time. But doing this is definitely worth it, once you're done building the best shed to keep your possessions.

I think the nails used were not that big to produce leaks, but I have to agree that it has to pass the favorable weather conditions. I hope the shed is still OK as of this moment. It looks very cute at the pictures. I think it’s not that bothering to have the scuff marks, it just look like a cat has scratched her paws on the roof. :)

<p>I was particularly chuffed, and even rather impressed to see that in Hertfordshire apparently &quot;just under 70 per cent of the county&#39;s household waste was sent for re-use, recycling or composting&quot; in April and June. That&#39;s scarcely believable actually, but I&#39;ve seen the increasing facilities and attention to separating waste for re-use at the local tip, and I&#39;d say that we personally recycle at about that rate. Now we&#39;ve moved into a house rather than a flat we have recycling boxes and a big green wheelie bin for garden waste and card, making it easier than ever.</p><p>We&#39;re doing a lot of work on the garden recently though so the big green bin is usually overflowing whereas the black bin just has a paltry amount of waste in the bottom, even with the 2 weeks between collections.</p><p><a href="http://www.stalbansreview.co.uk/news/4650041.Recycling_reaches_record_amounts/" target="_blank">Full story over at St Albans Review</a>.</p>

It looks like a tank. But I think it is better than the old boiler that have a lot of process to be done before you boiled fluid or water.

<p>I found a medium size moth on the wall a couple of days ago and decided I&#39;d try and figure out exactly what it was. I was already aware that there are many more species of moth as there are butterfly - something like 2,000+ in the UK apparently.</p><p>I started off by taking some up-close and personal photos of my moth, which was about 25mm long head to wing tip. Then I pored through my large &quot;Butterflies &amp; Moths in Britain and Europe&quot; book, recently acquired at a charity shop mainly to assist with butterfly identification. The only way to use this book when you have no idea what you&#39;re looking at is to flick through from cover to cover looking for a matching photograph. Then do the same again just in case you missed it. I was looking for a relatively dull, mottled brown beast with stripy legs, but I didn&#39;t find it.</p><p></p><p class="asset asset-image"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5814ac6970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="text-align: center;display: block; "><img alt="LargeRanunculusMoth" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a5814ac6970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5814ac6970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; margin: 0px;" /></a></p><p></p><p>I turned to the web and quickly found the rather excellent <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fukmoths.org.uk%2F&amp;ei=ZwK0SsPYL4mG4gbj55B9&amp;usg=AFQjCNHP__QMedAmSuHVGb0a-k2uzUhUYA" target="_blank">UK Moths</a> website, complete with keyword search. Unfortunately &quot;mottled brown&quot; and &quot;mottled grey&quot; didn&#39;t quite do the trick, returning tens of results but none of the quite what I was after. Lots of moths fit this very vague description so it&#39;s a tough one to solve with a simple text search. The best match I could find was the <a href="http://ukmoths.org.uk/show.php?id=3307" target="_blank">Grey Chi</a>, but I wasn&#39;t convinced as that&#39;s much more silvery and lacks the small orange markings, though I wondered if it could be put down to variability between individuals. So I turned to the site&#39;s creator Ian and fired off an image and description to the email address given (only to be used once all other avenues exhausted). He got back to me within a couple of days to reveal that it is in fact a&#0160;<a href="http://www.ukmoths.org.uk/show.php?id=1104" target="_blank">Large Ranunculus</a> - and yes I think he&#39;s bang on. This is a man who knows his moths!</p><p></p>

<p>The temperature controls in most fridges really get my design goat. Are they a thermostatic &#0160;&#39;temperature&#39; control or a &#39;power&#39; control? They&#39;re not giving anything away! If I want my fridge to be colder should I turn up the control to 5 for maximum cooling power, or turn it down to 1 as in 1 degree centigrade? Labelling it 1 to 5 is just begging for confusion. If it&#39;s truly a thermostat (and well enough calibrated) then make it clear with &#39;c&#39; markings. If it&#39;s a power control then make that clear with &quot;cooler&quot; / &quot;warmer&quot;, red / blue gradients or something. Perhaps I need to buy more expensive fridges with digital thermostatic controls.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5d1155f970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="FridgeControl" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a5d1155f970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5d1155f970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> </p>

At least they used a log scale on the control, giving some resolution at higher values of x . That's assuming x has some log response, of course, and it's far too early to think about cooling dynamics and refridgeration. I think it's a thermostatic control, otherwise the fridge would be running all the time!

Yes, I rather suspect it is thermostatic but it's a bit like the ones you get on radiators - very roughly setup with no calibration, so you just have to use trial and error to home in on the right setting. I reckon 5 is probably the coldest setting though.

Too true - same problem on the big fridge at the cricket club, just meaningless numbers so trial and error to find out which way is cooler. Lack of colour coding is just cost, so the designer should have added icons, like one snowflake, two snowflakes etc, easy really but there are a lot of dumb designers, and the senior managers that decide. I've met a few of the latter. Dad

BODY:
<p>Long Days has a hint of raspberry to make an interesting summer brew. Golden in colour and 4.5% ABV it&#39;s nicely weighted for a summer&#39;s day and the raspberry is not so much as to become cloying, but enough to make it stand apart from the competition.</p><p>I&#39;m a touch annoyed by the labelling on the bottle, which tells us that &quot;to celebrate the summer solstice in the past, ale was often brewed with raspberry leaves as an alleged aid to fertility&quot; but only mentions a &quot;subtle hint of raspberries&quot;, in such a manner that I suspect they didn&#39;t achieve it by adding the raspberry leaves they evocatively mention. I imagine that if they did then they&#39;d have been clear about it, so they probably get the raspberry flavour into the beer in a less romantic manner - perhaps by adding juice. Labelling like this always leaves me feeling like the brewer has tried to con me with their carefully chosen words, which is a shame as it&#39;s a good beer.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5cc3c49970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="LongDays" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a5cc3c49970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5cc3c49970c-350wi" style="width: 350px; " /></a> </p>

BODY:
<p>Every few months the scroll ball on my <a href="http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/" target="_blank">Apple Mighty Mouse</a>&#0160;starts to get a bit intermittent because of the build up of dirt, fibres and grease in the mechanism, which is very frustrating. For the past few days I&#39;ve only been able to scroll up, and reading web pages backwards is losing its novelty. There are a million and one web pages out there telling you how best to clean your ball, and I&#39;ve tried several of them.</p><p>Some people suggest <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jet7488UoSE" target="_blank">taking the mouse apart</a>, but that apparently incurs a high risk of cracking it, requiring gluing back together, and is clearly an all round monumental faff, so I count it as an option of last resort which thankfully I&#39;ve not had to employ yet.</p><p>Running a fine piece of sticky tape under the ball and flossing was a particularly delicate operation but didn&#39;t make much difference, so I don&#39;t recommend that.</p><p>Turning the mouse upside down and simply <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0z3fStz4Zo" target="_blank">rolling the ball around on a clean piece of paper</a> has the beauty of immediacy and simplicity and certainly helps a bit, but not if you&#39;ve got major problems.</p><p>Best of all is the application of WD40 (or even vodka as one German YouTuber advocates) then a good roll around with a clean rag. The idea is to get your cleaning fluid all around the ball so it cleans the rollers underneath, dissolving the grease and lifting fibres, so I recommend long circular movements in many directions, trying to get the ball going every which way. A second application may be required. Don&#39;t use too much fluid though or it may wreak havoc with the inside of your mouse. WD40 is just viscose enough, and easily sprayed on in a small quantity, so it&#39;s controllable. It sorts me out every time.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5c8c1ee970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="MightyMouseBall" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a5c8c1ee970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5c8c1ee970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> </p><p></p><p></p>

<p>We found this rather large beetle on the bedroom floor a few weeks back, which was a bit unexpected. However it seemed to be on its last legs and by the look of it was a bit gunged up with spider web and carpet fibres. I can&#39;t make up my mind whether it&#39;s a stag beetle or lesser stag beetle, though it&#39;s definitely a female. There are <a href="http://maria.fremlin.de/stagbeetles/photos_dp.html" target="_blank">some decent pages</a> out there trying to help in making this identification, but it&#39;s still not quite clear to me. If I had to put money on it I&#39;d go for lesser stag, because it&#39;s very black and seems to have some sort of ridges on its forelegs. I wish I&#39;d paid greater attention to the size at the time!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5b4b523970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="StagBeetle" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a5b4b523970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a5b4b523970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a couple of droppings on the lawn over the last week that I assumed might be cat, or maybe fox, but I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that it&#39;s almost definitely hedgehog. They&#39;re very dark, sticky and show evidence of bits of beetle. Though according to my research you&#39;d expect worms, fruit and seeds to be a major constituent too - which could well be the case here.</p><p>We have seen a hedgehog snuffling around the borders so it seems like a reasonable leap of logic. Cats don&#39;t tend to go on open grass, much preferring the freshly dug earth of the vegetable patch. There&#39;s not much for the urban fox in our back garden, and I&#39;d expect bigger doings from such an animal anyway.

BODY:
<p>Precisely one week after it was launched, my copy of Mac OS X 10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; landed on my desk at work. Apple claim to have posted it last Friday, but the bank holiday weekend and postal strikes have conspired to keep me waiting this long.</p>

<p>On my recent Mac Pro it installed in 28 minutes and recovered a startling 31GB of disk space. I&#39;m not quite sure how it managed that to be honest, as it&#39;s a lot more than most others are reporting. [<strong>Update:</strong> actually I suspect it&#39;s because Apple have changed the definition of a GB for Snow Leopard, so my comparisons of space used before and after are not comparing like for like. Now 1GB = 10^9 = 1,000,000,000 bytes, whereas previously it was 2^10 * 2^10 * 2^10 = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1,073,741,824 bytes.]</p><p>That same Mac Pro is also capable of booting into the 64 bit kernel by holding down &#39;6&#39; and &#39;4&#39; during boot. You can check it&#39;s worked in System Profiler, where on the Software page it should say&#0160;&#0160;&quot;64-bit Kernel and Extensions: Yes&quot;. I&#39;ve not noticed any abnormalities and supposedly it might run a bit faster this way, so if it stays good then&#0160;I&#39;ll probably set it to 64 bit kernel permanently.</p><p>Note that only XServe machines boot with the 64 bit kernel by default, and many 64 bit Macs (like older Core 2 Duo MacBooks) can&#39;t do so because they lack 64 bit EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface).</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a54b21db970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SnowLeopardDockMenu" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a54b21db970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a54b21db970b-800wi" title="SnowLeopardDockMenu" /></a> </p><p>In general I like Snow Leopard - it&#39;s the same as Leopard but all round snappier and a bit nicer. Some changes confuse me though. Take the new arbitrarily styled menus for dock items, as shown below. Nothing else in the system looks the same, and that&#39;s probably a good thing because it&#39;s hard to read, with the section heads and tick marks being far too low contrast. They&#39;re almost invisible! A real UI own goal if you ask me. Maybe they designed it before they <a href="/atc/2009/06/snow-leopard-gamma-22.html" target="_blank">set the gamma to 2.2</a>...</p>

The long legs and slender body suggest it&#39;s a male, which makes sense as it&#39;s the males out roaming for a mate at this time of year, which is why we see so many of them all of a sudden.</p>

I think there is one on my ceiling in the florida room-though I'm not sure.  It keeps creeping closer and closer to the sliding glass doors.  I really want to get a closer look.  If its not dangerous I dont want to kill it-I assume it eats cockroaches...how can I be sure?

bernieandjim - if you can send a picture, I'll let you know what I think you've got! Assuming you're in the UK, there are no spiders that properly dangerous as far as I'm aware, though a few can give you a bit of a nip if you annoy them.

Hi Sam
There are 2 spiders in the UK that bite and that's the  woodlouse spider and the raft spider largest of the British spiders and are semi aquatic.  Both can give quite a nasty bite but  quite harmless but woodlouse spiders bite can in some cases cause blood infections. :)

<p>Last night we went down to Verulamium Park to watch bats. That&#39;s&#0160;the big park in St Albans with river, lake, trees, Roman ruins etc. It was also a marvellous opportunity to refresh ourselves with the occasional ale from different pubs along the way, but that&#39;s by the by.</p>

<p>At half eight we emerged from the Fighting Cocks (a contender for Britain&#39;s oldest pub, though a weak one I think) and sure enough we were surrounded by swooping bats by the edge of the lake, emerging from the trees. It was pretty dark, but you could just about see them silhouetted against the dim sky.

<p>I took my camera, knowing that it was rather optimistic. I set to ISO 1600 (or 3200, or even higher at times) and f2.8 using a 105mm lens and quickly discovered that flash was an absolute necessity, not surprisingly. The on-camera flash (I don&#39;t have an external unit) allowed me to keep the shutter speed around 1/200s but still at super-high ISO. However I had to fix the focus manually at a distance about 4 yards ahead and aim extremely approximately with the camera away from my eye. It was quite impossible to see and track anything through the viewfinder, so it really was pot luck firing into the gloom as I saw one pass by. Most shots were of blank, black sky. A few included a small blob, blurry from both motion and incorrect focus. However I did luck out and get one shot that was head and shoulders above the rest. It&#39;s clearly a bat, though you can&#39;t say much more than that. You should have seen the rejects.</p>

<p>For a while now, classical music has filled the small ground level part of Kentish Town tube station in the evenings. Maybe it's more than just the evenings but that's when I tend to notice it.</p>

<p>I imagine this is intended to be calming to the frustrated and weary traveller, perhaps reducing the amount of aggro the staff get. I've heard of similar schemes used elsewhere. If nothing else I imagine it keeps the staff amused seeing as they have to stand in that small hall all day. Personally I only wish they'd turn the volume up!</p>

BODY:
<p>I happened across a Speckled Wood butterfly on our apple tree, that apparently didn&#39;t mind me shoving an iPhone about two inches from its delicate self. It was well into a sunny day so I didn&#39;t expect it to be so docile.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a514612c970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SpeckledWoodButterfly" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a514612c970b selected " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a514612c970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> </p>

<p>It also made for an interesting test of iPhone macro camera capability. The results in this picture are fair, though it has smeared the subtle feathery detail in the wing quite badly. I suppose that&#39;s to be expected from such a tiny sensor, with lots of anti-noise processing to compensate. The biggest difficulty I found was getting it to reliably focus on the point I was interested in, resulting in lots of shots of an in-focus leaf and a blurry butterfly. Theoretically you can tap the screen to indicate the point for focussing and metering, but I didn&#39;t find that to work particularly well. Worst of all it doesn&#39;t give any obvious positive or negative feedback on whether it thinks it has successfully locked on or not. I&#39;d like it to flash a green square when it&#39;s got a good AF lock, and maybe a red disintegrating one if it has failed.</p>

<p>Note that this is a crop from the original. Click for higher res. Another major annoyance of the iPhone&#39;s Camera app is that when viewing the photos, it shows a low-res blurry version when zoomed in, leading you to think that the camera is significantly worse than it is, and making is very difficult to check focus. I really can&#39;t understand why they&#39;d do this!</p>

Not only was it relatively small for a change, but the BarclayCard website has been revamped, with that most unusual of results: a markedly better user experience!</p><p>They now show a coloured bar meter indicating your total credit limit (the whole length of the bar) with your last statement and current total outstanding clearly marked as coloured portions of it. It&#39;s a really great way to graphically show the balance. They&#39;ve clearly paid attention to every aspect of user interaction, with the flow being very straightforward and very clearly guided at all times, but not onerous.</p><p>Perhaps the very best change is the return of the option to pay off your last statement in full. For the last year or so they had things set up so the options when paying were: minimum amount, whole balance (including new transactions since last statement) or custom amount. To pay off your last statement in full you had to manually read off the amount and type it into the custom field. This was very cheeky of them, clearly trying to steer the punters into taking less advantage of the free credit grace period (by paying more than their last statement amount) or paying less than their last statement amount and so accruing expensive interest. I&#39;m glad to see this cynical move has been reversed.</p>

<p>A good few weeks back now, we visited <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-angleseyabbeyandgardenandlodemill.htm" target="_blank">Anglesey Abbey, Gardens and Lode Mill</a> - a National Trust property near Cambridge. As usual no photos of the house (it&#39;s not allowed) so you&#39;ll have to take it on trust that it was an enchanting time-warp covering the last several centuries, with a warm, lived-in feeling.</p>

<p>The gardens were large and diverse, with natural woodland, formal gardens, meadows and everything in-between. There was a strong emphasis on nature, with many habitats set up to encourage wildlife. In one corner runs the river smothered in lily pads, to Lode Mill - an interesting building in its own right, but sadly the gear wasn&#39;t working when we were there. Moorhen chicks ran across the leafy surface of the river seldom touching the water and Banded Demoiselle damselflies glinted in the sun.</p><p>Onto the pictures! First, a rather fun door in the middle of the woods, followed by a Painted Lady butterfly at the edge of the dew pond.</p>

BODY:
<p>When is a Dishwasher door not a dishwasher door? When it&#39;s a jar.</p><p>That&#39;s a joke by the way. It&#39;s especially a joke if you have a Siemens dishwasher who&#39;s door is not designed to be left ajar.&#0160;You can have it fully open, or fully closed, but it won&#39;t rest in any position in-between unless you prop it open, e.g. with a cork or other handy item that you may have to hand, as per my picture below.</p>
<p>Why would I want to prop it open? Because after it&#39;s finished, if you open the door for 15 minutes then the residual heat dries the contents just nicely, as long as the steam can escape. If you don&#39;t open the door, you can look forward to plates and glasses that still need the attention of a tea towel, even several hours after the machine finishes its cycle. Leaving the door fully open is asking for a kitchen accident of course, so that&#39;s not really an option. This door ajar approach is standard practice with any dishwasher, no? Maybe I&#39;m alone in this, but every other dishwasher I&#39;ve come across neatly sits open a few inches to facilitate my whim, and it&#39;s got to be trivially easy to manufacture into the door mechanism. Certainly my posh Siemens dishwasher would look a lot better without the cork.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a4fe790c970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="DishwasherCork" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a4fe790c970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a4fe790c970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> </p>

Pull the upper rack out a couple of inches and that will prop open the door.

<p>A mobile beer review today! Who says variety is dead?</p><p>Here we see pictured the can of Arkell&#39;s 3B that quenched my frazzled business brain after a hard day out of the office a month or so ago. This was on a train back from Swindon to London to be precise, and I have to say that the availability of a half decent drop of bitter on the train was a pleasant surprise. <a href="http://www.arkells.com/" target="_blank">Arkell&#39;s</a> is actually a Swindon based brewery too, so it&#39;s nice to see the big nasty train company keeping the food miles down and offering local producers.</p><p>It&#39;s got a decent colour to it, and the well rounded maltiness you&#39;d hope to find from that colour. At 4% the weight is just about right for the circumstances. All in all it was very welcome and dare I say even recommended if you find yourself near Swindon on a train, even out of a small plastic cup!</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a4e5a4bd970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Arkells3B" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a4e5a4bd970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a4e5a4bd970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> </p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that in iPhone&#39;s Calendar, you can&#39;t change the calendar (Home,Work, etc.) of an entry once it&#39;s been created - only at the point that it is being created. This is immensely frustrating as quite often I fail to spot which calendar an entry is being created in until after I&#39;ve hit Done and I see it showing up in green or blue in my calendar. I split about 50/50 between Home and Work entries and so very often each new entry is of a different type to the last (though I fail to notice it) leaving the default calendar assignation incorrect. Grrrr.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> I realised that a big reason for failing to spot which calendar is being used at point of entry is that it doesn&#39;t use the calendar colour in the creation UI - only the name. If it backed the name with a big splash of colour (green for home, blue for work) I for one would be far less likely to mess up.</p>

If you sync your calendar with your iCal, you can update the calender in iCal.

I agree completely! It's a pain not to be able to change the Calendar when you can change everything else in Edit mode. Sure, you can do it in iCal, but the POINT is you should be able to do it on your iPhone as well.

I'm running into this as well, because I just brought over a bunch of entries from Entourage, and of course they're all assigned to a third default "Entourage" calendar. It would be great if I could chip away at this during the day when I get a few moments, converting "Entourage" entries into either "Home" or "Work". Alas, no such luck.

In that case I look forward to iOS 4 on my phone. I hope it also improves all the other niggles I have with Calendar, like not showing birthdays - which has caused me to miss a couple recently.

BODY:
<p>This old house has lots of old door knobs, but some are a bit worse for wear. I&#39;ve already repaired a broken spring in one with some cobbled together bits from an old wooden clothes peg, but that&#39;s another story. Another was lacking a crucial grub screw that meant the knob on one side just rotated freely, rather than operating the latch. The nice guy at Alban Locksmiths furnished me with an Imperial threaded screw that fits. However I needed a grub screw - one where there is no &#39;head&#39; so to speak so that it can worm its way right into the hole.</p>

<p>No problem! Just saw the head off the normal screw then saw a notch in the end for the screwdriver. Here&#39;s a pictorial essay of my approach, the only trick of any merit being to clamp the screw between two bits of soft wood in the vice, so that it&#39;s gripped securely and you can saw it without it slipping or being damaged.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a52ae9b0970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="GrubScrew 1" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a52ae9b0970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a52ae9b0970c-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>&#0160;&#0160;<a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a52ae9ee970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="GrubScrew 2" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a52ae9ee970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a52ae9ee970c-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a> </p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a4d3e02e970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="GrubScrew 3" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a4d3e02e970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a4d3e02e970b-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>&#0160;&#0160;<a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a52aeaaa970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="GrubScrew 4" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a52aeaaa970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a52aeaaa970c-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a> </p>

<div>Because my broadband wasn&#39;t working I&#39;ve been using internet tethering with my iPhone for my main internet connection for my computer. So when my iPhone demanded I update its software to cure its SMS vulnerability I thought hey why not go ahead! I figured it would download the update to the computer (via the iPhone&#39;s net connection) as per normal, then perform the update. No reason to suspect a problem.&#0160;</div><br /><div>Unfortunately once it had got the whole 300MB package and tried to install it, it required access to some Apple server in order to finish the install, but the iPhone was half-updated and no longer providing internet connectivity. So I got stuck there, with an iPhone just showing a &quot;connect to iTunes&quot; graphic when switched on. I understand this is known as &quot;<a href="http://mickerlodeon.com/2009/03/iphone-recovery-mode-how-to/" target="_blank">recovery mode</a>&quot;. And that&#39;s how it&#39;s been for a full day, but thankfully I now have broadband working and have managed to get it back up on its feet. That required a factory restore then update from backup then full sync though, and I&#39;m yet to determine if all is truly well.</div><br /><div>So the lesson here is - don&#39;t use your iPhone as the sole internet connection in order to update your iPhone!</div>

As such I&#39;m using my iPhone with internet tethering as my internet connection.</div><br /><div>It works reasonably well, maxing out at about 50 kilobytes/s - which equates to about half a megabit, so stretching the term broadband quite thin but useable as long as you&#39;re not in a hurry. However I&#39;ve noticed that O2 are pulling a fast one (pun intended) and rewriting JPEG and GIF images that you request via HTTP, re-encoding them at a much lower quality level, presumably in order to make your bandwidth go that much further.</div><br /><div>I have a problem with this though as they&#39;ve gone so far down the quality slope that the images are often no longer fit for purpose, with small text unreadable and photos suffering from JPEG artefacts so badly that there&#39;s only a muddy mess left. Here&#39;s a small screenshot from my blog sidebar, showing the knackered JPEG, which I have saved with very high quality JPEG compression so as not to introduce more artefacts. Of course when I review this post it&#39;ll get re-compressed by O2 again and look even more terrible (indeed the hyperlink text is near unreadable) but hopefully you won&#39;t have that problem unless you&#39;re also tethering.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="O2CompressedJPEG" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340120a51c7d5e970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340120a51c7d5e970c-800wi" title="O2CompressedJPEG" /><br /></div><br /><div>So this is a plea to O2, asking them to turn up the quality, if they must mess with the web at all.</div>

BODY:
<div>I had a couple of long train journeys today, so this morning just after I boarded that train at Paddington I followed the instructions on my iPhone to turn on <a href="http://shop.o2.co.uk/update/internet.html" target="_blank">internet tethering</a>. This would allow me to use its 3G internet connection on my laptop via bluetooth, enabling me to get some work done. Brilliant!</div><br /><div>Follow the instructions to enable it and you end up with a fiddly web form that requires you to manually fill in the details that O2 already have for you. How&#39;s that for an integrated experience?! Terrible, that&#39;s how. And then the coup de grace - it&#39;s 14 hours later and internet tethering has still not been turned on for my phone. Both train journeys have been and gone, I&#39;m starved of juicy internet goodness and O2 are presumably laughing at me whilst making a small tower from 15 of my pound coins.</div><br /><div>Their instructions do say it could take up to 24 hours to come alive, but it&#39;s natural to assume that this is a worst case caveat, like Royal Mail saying you&#39;re not allowed to complain about 1st class mail until it&#39;s gone missing for 7 days - a backup clause to cover exceptional circumstances. Apparently O2 are serious, perhaps to deliberately discourage people who are in any way impulsive from stupidly parting with their money for such an overpriced service. Perhaps they&#39;re on our side after all...</div><br /><div><strong>Update:</strong> about 30 hours have now passed since I bought the tethering bolt on. Now not only does my phone still not have data tethering, but it has no data connection whatsoever. So I can&#39;t get email, visual voicemail, web etc. on the phone itself, let alone on a tethered device. A quick call to O2&#39;s magic iPhone support number gives me a recorded message that they&#39;re having trouble in the London area with &#39;network congestion&#39;. I don&#39;t see why this innocuous Tuesday would result in a tidal wave of traffic that brings their service to its knees, unless it&#39;s simply the continuing weight of iPhones being added to its network every day as they continue to sell like hotcakes.</div>

<div>I can&#39;t believe I haven&#39;t reviewed this before now as it&#39;s a classic and a firm favourite of mine. At 5% ABV and with just enough honey to notice but not overpower, this is a well balanced brew. This is true in every sense with not too much bitterness either - just enough to counter the &#0160;sweetness. It doesn&#39;t taste as alcoholic as it is and I reckon it&#39;s a perfect if-you&#39;re-going-to-have-just-one-beer-in-an-evening beverage. I prefer it reasonably chilled - more so than less sweet ales - which probably makes me a philistine, but so be it. It&#39;s quite similar in style to some of the more floral, sweet and spicy Badger beers, of which I am also a huge fan.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115710fe117970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="HoneydewBeer" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340115710fe117970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115710fe117970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> <br /></div>

Fullers seem to be treating this as a lager, and actually advise that it is served cover ice with a wedge of lime! What the F***???

Yes, I've noticed Fullers serving it via nasty lager-style taps, ice cold. On the plus side, maybe it can be a gateway beer to lure those who'd only ever usually touch lager?

Jeremy - I'm humbled that you should grace my blog. It is indeed a Golf GTI - albeit heavily modified to look exactly like a Lagonda, possibly a LG45 of some sort, circa 1936/7. I'm having to guess that from looking at pictures at <a href="http://www.lagondaclub.co.uk/">http://www.lagondaclub.co.uk/</a> since all I have is my original pictures from the event (albeit larger, less cropped ones than above).

If I was the first one to guess what car this is, I would have had the same guess as Jeremy. It's Golf GTi. Haha!

<div>On a balmy summer&#39;s day (the day of the men&#39;s final at Wimbledon) we ventured back to <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-shawscorner" target="_blank">Shaw&#39;s Corner</a> for a stroll around its beautifully relaxed gardens. This is where playwright George Bernard Shaw lived for over 40 years. The house and gardens aren&#39;t huge, but I like their style - lazy, slow, ambling and pleasant. Lawns, shady paths, vibrant flowerbeds, meadowy orchards, languid trees, and all kept in a not-too-formal style that sees the stresses ooze out of me.</div><br /><div>I only had my macro lens, so no sweeping panoramas - you&#39;ll have to take my word for it on the descriptions above, or visit the National Trust page I&#39;ve linked to for that sort of thing.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011570f25d16970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ShawsCorner 7618" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834011570f25d16970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011570f25d16970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011571e70c90970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ShawsCornerGreenery 7620" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834011571e70c90970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011571e70c90970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">This is a slightly frayed Comma butterfly, amidst the meadowy flowers and grasses.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011571e70d20970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ShawsCornerCommaButterfly 7619" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834011571e70d20970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011571e70d20970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> <br /></div>

It is a fabulous place to relax  - and a lovely reminder of how life once was (if you were fairly wealthly of course)....if ever I had the money, this would be be the house and garden of my dreams...not too ostentatious - a real homely pad!

<p>I hear that Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard will herald the return of the permanently visible event inspector panel in iCal. I&#39;ve really missed it for the last couple of years. Double clicking each item then clicking &quot;Edit&quot; is a major chore and I look forward to getting back to the simple old ways.</p><p>Whilst they&#39;re at it I hope they fix the basic mouse event handling so I can reliably grab and drag the edges of an event. The current behaviour seems to be based on coin flips.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>It&#39;s not quite what I hoped unfortunately. Rather than having a fixed panel for displaying and editing the full details of the currently selected event, there is a popup window. In exactly the same manner as the Finder&#39;s Get Info window, this can also be opened as an &#39;inspector&#39; that changes to reflect the current selection. It is always a floating window above the rest of the UI rather than a built-in portion of the main iCal window like it used to be. I&#39;ve arranged my main iCal window and inspector alongside each other and thankfully they both reappear when the app is quit and reopened. So nearly, but not quite what I was after.</p>

BODY:
<div>I&#39;ve been putting together a WordPress powered blog or two recently and diligently documenting the steps required, as ever. The documentation available from the WordPress site is pretty good, but sometimes it&#39;s over verbose, whilst frustratingly also stopping short of giving you exactly the details you need. So here&#39;s what works for me to upgrade an existing WordPress installation to a newer version. This is using the manual approach BTW rather than the built in auto-upgrade functionality, which asks for FTP details (of what I&#39;m not sure, and it doesn&#39;t bother to elaborate) and therefore makes a mockery of the term &#39;auto&#39;.</div><br /><div>The official instructions that got me going initially are at&#0160;<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress" target="_blank">http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress</a> FWIW, but I do precisely this on Mac OS X:</div><div><div><ul>
<li>Download the zipped upgrade package and unzip it&#0160;somewhere&#0160;-&#0160;e.g.&#0160;to&#0160;wordpress_upgrade&#0160;directory&#0160;for&#0160;the&#0160;sake&#0160;of&#0160;this&#0160;example.</li>
<li>Backup existing installation in full - both the wordpress directory itself and the associated MySQL DB, just in case.</li>
<li>Merge the newly downloaded package over your existing install (assumed to be a directory named wordpress here) with the following incantation at the command line, which takes advantage of the fact that cp merges, whereas Finder copying just oafishly replaces:</li>
<li><span>&gt; cp -r&#0160;</span>&#0160;wordpress_upgrade/ wordpress_original</li>
<li>Compare the new wp-config-sample.php with your existing wp-config.php (e.g. using FileMerge) to see if any new config items have been added. If so, manually add those into your&#0160;wp-config.php&#0160;file, or if easier rename the sample to&#0160;wp-config.php&#0160;and put back the DB connection and other relevant bits.</li>
<li><span>Load up the /admin page in your web browser and follow the instructions to complete&#0160;the&#0160;upgrade,&#0160;which&#0160;involves&#0160;it&#0160;upgrading&#0160;any&#0160;DB&#0160;bits,&#0160;etc.</span></li>

<p>You receive your sparkly newiPhone, plug it into your Mac, everything works - and calendars are synced. A few days later you realise that all is not well as calendar updates only make the jump when you physically connect phone to the Mac and sync, but MobileMe's supposed to sync over the air with push updates and all that jazz. Turns out you need to do the following, which isn't entirely intuitive:</p>

<ul>
<li>Perform a full physical sync to ensure all data on phone is on your Mac and therefore in the MobileMe system.</li>
<li>On the iPhone go to Settings > Mail, Contacts and Calendars</li>
<li>Select your me.com/mac.com Mail account</li>
<li>Turn on the switches for syncing contacts, calendar and bookmarks as you wish.</li>
<li>This will ask what you want to do with the data already on the phone. Select "Do not merge" and then when prompted agree that it can indeed delete the existing data from your phone.</li>
<li>Et voila, all your data is still there and changes you make on Mac or iPhone swiftly wing their way across the void to the others.</li>

Thank you very much! You're right: this isn't intuitive. I had apparently previously merged the data, thus duplicating all my contacts and calendars. I learned I needed to turn off MobileMe syncing to delete one set of data, but I couldn't figure out how to delete the other set so I could re-enable MobileMe syncing. Your instructions did the trick!

<div>I've had my iPhone for a few days now, though Orange haven't got their colourful arses in gear to supply me with the PAK code required to get my old number working yet. Looks like they're sticking to the "allow seven working days" mantra, whilst also sticking two fingers up to me. There must be a line in their systems software that says "wait 5 days" before then actually sending out the letter I need. But I digress.</div><br><div>The Calendar app on iPhone has a major flaw. If you're part way through entering a new event to the calendar and a call comes in, it simply discards all the data you'd entered. When you next open Calendar it implacably stares back at you with your events neatly listed, but no memory of what you were busy entering before you were interrupted. The same is true when you press the home button, perhaps to flick to Mail in order to get a piece of information that you wanted to add into your calendar entry. Actually this is how I discovered the problem, since I don't get many calls. This is a disaster and violates a prime iPhone app programming law: reinstate things how the user left them.</div>

<p>Email apps generally have 'Reply' and 'Reply to all' as options for responding. But I crave an extra option: Reply to all as CCs. This would put the original sender on the To line and all of the original To recipients as CCs (except me obviously).</p>

<p>This contrasts with the usual reply all behaviour which puts all original To recipients on the To line, which is often not what I want, even though they were all on the To line of the original. Maybe I'm just strange. </p>

BODY:
<div>We recently spent a very nice 24 hours in Helsinki, Finland before crossing the strait to Tallinn, Estonia. Helsinki is quite a modern city and its delights are subtle. We very nearly didn&#39;t go to the Church in the Rock, having failed to realise that it&#39;s one of the top tourist attractions. You wouldn&#39;t know it from the humble location in the middle of a rather nondescript residential area.</div>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115714115f7970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="HelsinkiChurchRock3 7398" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340115714115f7970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115714115f7970b-400wi" style="width: 400px;" /></a></div>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<div>Built in the late 1960s the church is sunk into the bedrock with just a domed roof poking above the natural lie of the land. It&#39;s really not much to look at from the outside, but internally it&#39;s a symphony of modernist concrete, rough-hewn stone, glass, wood and polished copper. It really speaks craftsmanship and slightly old fashioned Scandinavian design. It also has fantastic acoustics - there was a woman playing a grand piano as we wandered around, which just set it all off perfectly.</div>

BODY:
<div>This is a decidedly exotic beer. In fact you may struggle to identify it as beer at all if presented a glass of it. To look at, it&#39;s a deep, ever so slightly cloudy colour that can only really be described as &#39;raspberry&#39;. Which isn&#39;t surprising because that&#39;s what&#39;s in it - 30% of it in fact.</div><br /><div>It tastes like finely sparkling raspberry juice with a slightly tart/sour beery edge. Those non-fruit flavours are the Belgian Lambic beer - fermented with yeasts that simply drift in on the air and give Lambics their characteristic sourness - just like sourdough bread in principle. Some Lambics can be face-puckeringly sour, but this has so much sweet fruit that it&#39;s tempered to just a cheeky edge that&#39;s enough to make it interesting. At only 2.5% alcohol by volume and with so much fruit, it&#39;s got to be almost good for you! Ones probably enough at one sitting though, before moving onto something a bit more normal.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115712ff889970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="LindemansFramboise 7214" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340115712ff889970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115712ff889970b-350wi" style="width: 350px; " /></a> <br /></div>

BODY:
<p>Say you&#39;ve got a Ramaze web application quite happily running at http://foo.com/ but you want to have the whole app running at http://foo.com/myapp/. It&#39;s not unusual to want to do this, for various reasons, and it&#39;s relatively easy to arrange by setting a single piece of Ramaze config.</p>

<p>The exact way to do this depends on the version of Ramaze you&#39;re using, as the options system changed between the 2009.03 and 2009.04 gem versions. Here&#39;s the syntax for Ramaze version 2009.03 and previous:</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier;">Ramaze::Global.prefix = &#39;/myapp&#39;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;;">And here&#39;s the syntax for Ramaze 2009.04 and later, which requires setting the prefix for links (as before) and a routing rule for stripping it off incoming requests (since it no longer does it automatically):</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier, Verdana, sans-serif;">app_prefix = &#39;/myapp&#39;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier, Verdana, sans-serif;">Ramaze.options.prefix = app_prefix</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Courier, Verdana, sans-serif;">Ramaze::Route[ /^#{app_prefix}(.*)$/ ] = &#39;%s&#39;</span></p>

<p>The prefix will be automatically added onto the front of all URLs created by Ramaze&#39;s built-in URL and link creator methods (R, Rs and A from the link helper). It will also be stripped off the front of all incoming requests by the dispatcher (for Ramaze 2009.03) or by the routing rule (for later versions). So your own application code doesn&#39;t need to be aware that it&#39;s running with a prefix at all, unless you create absolute URLs via means other than the link helper methods. In that case you will need to use Ramaze::Global.prefix or Ramaze.options.prefix in your own link construction code to get them right.</p>

<p>One thing which might catch you out is forgetting to put the forward slash on the front of the prefix. If you set the prefix to &#39;myapp&#39; it won&#39;t work - it has to be &#39;/myapp&#39;.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Note that static files (those in your public directory) are not affected by any of the above changes. Furthermore, chances are that you refer to them with absolute paths from your HTML anyway - e.g. for images, CSS, JavaScript. So further thought will be required to handle these.</p>

<div>Apple have finally patched up some serious security holes in their Java distributions with Mac OS X. I had a problem when trying to install it, getting the simple message <em>The update &quot;Java for OS X 10.5 Update 4&quot; can&#39;t be installed</em> almost immediately after pressing the Install button (it didn&#39;t even start downloading). I&#39;d just freshly started up my Mac and the browser wasn&#39;t running (it specifically instructs you to quit all browsers) so that wasn&#39;t the problem.</div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115711d0315970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="JavaUpdate4Fail" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340115711d0315970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115711d0315970b-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>&#0160;</div><div>Repairing permissions on my startup disk with Disk Utility then restarting seemed to fix it and allow the installation to proceed. Now I have 1.6.0_13 successfully installed.</div><br /><div><strong>Update:</strong> Exactly the same experience on my PowerMac G5 (original attempt was on an Intel MacBook). Same problem, same solution. Could it be because I&#39;ve previously used the Java Preferences app to switch between JVM versions (like you&#39;re supposed to)? It&#39;s just about conceivable that the way the prefs app performs the switching leaves permissions a bit messed up as far as the installer is concerned, but none of the permissions it claimed to have fixed looked to be related in any way. Maybe it was more the restart that helped. Certainly just fixing permissions alone was not enough.</div>

BODY:
<div>WWDC has begun and more information is trickling out about Mac OS X 10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot;. I like what I see, but one thing really stood out as intriguing: default gamma will be 2.2 rather than the traditional Mac setting of 1.8. It&#39;s one of the many items mentioned on this page:&#0160;<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/refinements/enhancements-refinements.html" target="_blank">http://www.apple.com/macosx/refinements/enhancements-refinements.html</a>. This is going to be important for photographers and graphic artists in particular.</div><br /><div>What does it mean? Gamma refers to the way numerical colour representations are mapped to real colours on the screen - specifically how the luminance is mapped, i.e. how light they appear. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction" target="_blank">Wikipedia explains gamma in full</a>, complete with some neat sample images to show how different gamma settings affect the way an image looks. Windows PCs traditionally use system gamma setting of 2.2 whereas Macs go for 1.8, which means that the same image tends to look darker on the PC than on the Mac, assuming that the image doesn&#39;t contain colour profile information, which is the case for most images and videos on the web. Mac users create pictures to look just right on their monitor and are disappointed when the image looks dark and dingy on their PC using friends&#39; machines. Conversely, the PC artist is surprised that the image they create looks bright and washed out on their friends&#39; Macs. And neither of them generally have a clue that this is because of the different gamma settings of the systems!</div><br /><div>It seems that Apple have decided to bite the bullet and get in line with the popular 2.2 standard to end this perennial confusion. This is a major step for Apple to take and I imagine they had to think long and hard over it, but it&#39;s probably for the best in the long term.</div>

<div>I&#39;ve been working on an iPhone app that uses location data extensively. From poring through the raw data that comes from CLLocationManager I&#39;ve learned a few interesting things. In particular it seems that CLLocation objects with negative (i.e. invalid) verticalAccuracy value were likely derived from non-GPS sources - e.g. triangulation from cell towers or SkyHook WiFi positioning. In my app I really need only the purest, most accurate data so I&#39;m choosing to ignore non-GPS data and this is how I can tell it apart in order to do that.</div><br /><div>It took a while for this realisation to dawn on me as I was seeing occasional poor data points mixed in with the good ones, and this seems to be because it occasionally slips in a non-GPS location in certain circumstances.</div>

I would need an API to do that dynamically for just my app. If there is such an API I'm not aware of it, so my workaround suffices in order to ignore the data I'm not interested in.

TruePosition offers a service to track mobile phones based off of their location using cell phone radio's, instead of GPS. Triangulation between multiple mobile phone signals offers movement tracking of people both indoors and outdoors which is useful for asset tracking, surveillance, and 911 instances.

OK, good info.  BUT more importantly, WTF is up with that exception?  I'm getting this same BS, and nowhere in my code do I call timeIntervalSinceReference date.  I'm doing some work with NSDates and CLLocations, but obviously I'm not calling that method on a CLLocation.  What was the story in your case?

That being 2.5 years ago and my memory being like a sieve, I'm afraid I haven't a clue. I can't even remember writing that blog post to be honest, though that's why I write them frankly - because I know I tend to forget stuff. I can only apologise for not also writing up what was causing my exception. Sorry.

I presume that the error message tells no lies and that somehow that erroneous call is being made.

BODY:
<div>If you go to Pizza Express, this is what you must order to drink! They may only serve two different beers (the other being bog standard Peroni) but it's worth it just for this one. At 6.6% and packed with malty flavour (Birra Doppio Malto as it says on the label) it's a real standout bottled lager. I was seriously happy to see it in the supermarket, and it tastes just as good at home, especially at a third the price the restaurant charges. Repeat - this is not an ordinary lager - just look at the colour in the glass. It is to be savoured.</div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a style="display: inline;" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156fc1881c970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img  class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401156fc1881c970c " style="width: 350px; " alt="PeroniGranRiserva 6861" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156fc1881c970c-350wi"></a> <br></div>

Just bought this from the supermarket, pricey but well worth it. Can't believe it was 6.6%, didn't taste strong at all, very subtle flavours.

just bought this beer, after having one too many so it's a bit difficult to try and grasp the real tasting notes. It, however, has a pungent touch when it comes to taste and smell, quite malty but maybe because all I had were Asahi & Quilmes which were light and smooth. At 6.6% I wouldn't have more than two. I think it's a real man's beer with it's clean and straight forward taste. Next: White beer from Belgium!

<div>This is a challenging beer. It sticks two fingers up to you, even from the shelf with it&#39;s &quot;I&#39;m not a fuddy duddy ale&quot; packaging. Once you&#39;ve picked it up the label continues with the bolshiness, suggesting that you&#39;re probably not man enough to drink it. Challenge accepted!</div><br /><div>It&#39;s a proper old-school IPA at 6% and heavily hopped - as were the original India Pale Ales, to survive the long journey by boat from England to India, if I&#39;ve got my beer history right. However the bitterness of the hops is a bit too no-holds-barred for my liking and any other subtle flavours are mostly bashed into submission.

<div>For my sins I&#39;ve been watching Britain&#39;s Got Talent on the tele, and I thought Susan Boyle was rubbish. Apparently I was in the minority. Her first few notes of Memory missed utterly and she was a bit reedy through most of the tricky bits. Am I the only person that finds her just plain annoying when she&#39;s not singing? Her fist-pumping, full-of-herself celebrations are very un-British and I suspect that the fickle public will turn. That said, I suppose rather sadly that it will be the newspapers that decide whether we should like or loath her, whether her start should soar or tumble. They&#39;ve decided she&#39;s an angel and are unlikely to go back on their reckoning.</div><br /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update - 28th May 2009:</span> Apparently it has begun, right on cue:</div><br /><div><a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6161198.ece" target="_blank">http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6161198.ece</a><br /></div><br /><div><a href="http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/blog/article/188332/" target="_blank">http://uk.tv.yahoo.com/blog/article/188332/</a><br /></div><br />

I absolutely agree with you. And don't you think that nearly all of the acts were pretty dire? The exception being Diversity, who at least were entertaining. Sue Son has great potential but was overshadowed by whoever decided that her act needed such a powerful backing track and visual display.
If this is the best of British talent - gawd help us all! And Gawd help the Queen who will have to endure all this rubbish....

Yes - I think that the overall standard has been rather poor and ultimately a bit embarrassing. Tonight's shower of grinning idiots was even worse, with only Flawless actually having any talent of note. I'm turning into an old curmudgeon!

<div>I&#39;ve done a lot of web development in my time and a lot of that time is usually sucked up in trying to make a site &#39;scale&#39; well &#0160;- not in terms of dealing with vast quantities of users, but responding to changes in font size without the page layout going completely screwy.</div><br /><div>Generally the user can change the font size on the fly to suit themselves, and as a page designer you really ought to cater to their whim. This means that you can&#39;t assume that your carefully setup sidebar links will always require just one line each, or that your box titles will always fit in the space available. It can be a nightmare to get right and if you have a very &#39;designed&#39; page you often have to accept that it will only look reasonable within a certain font size range. Here&#39;s one of my blog posts unzoomed, looking handsome as always:</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115709a4ff4970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BrowserZoom1" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340115709a4ff4970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340115709a4ff4970b-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a> <br /></div><div>I&#39;ve noticed that web browsers have increasingly been looking to solve this problem without troubling the poor page designers. Safari 4 Beta and Firefox 3 now default to simply scaling the entire page rather than just the text, though you can select a &quot;Zoom Text Only&quot; menu option to go back to the previous behaviour. By zooming every last pixel of the page identically, page layout and design are kept together and in the originally intended proportions no matter what, though any images on the page may start to look a bit fuzzy as they get zoomed up beyond their native size.</div><br /><div>Here&#39;s that same blog post of mine with text-only-zoom and then everything-zoom in Safari:</div><br /><div><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156fa50277970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BrowserZoom2" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401156fa50277970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156fa50277970c-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>&#0160;<a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156fa502a5970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BrowserZoom3" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401156fa502a5970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156fa502a5970c-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a> <br /></div><div>You&#39;ll notice that Typepad have done a really good job of making their site text-zoom friendly, and with everything zoomed (and not zoomed quite so much) the whole page is too wide to be usable. Horses for courses I suppose - there are going to be cases when each method is superior and hopefully users (ones that care about zooming at all) will be savvy enough to choose what works for them.</div>

A minute later, after my laptop has synced I get a popup informing me of the clash of snoozed times, which I have to resolve and re-sync.

<div>I&#39;ve been writing some iPhone apps recently and have thus been re-exposed to the horror that is Objective-C. I&#39;ve written plenty of Objective-C over the years, but coming back to it from proper modern languages like Java, C# and Ruby is just painful. It&#39;s really showing it&#39;s age and I harbour a hope that the macruby work Apple&#39;s doing right now is actually going to become the official way to write Mac and even iPhone software over the coming couple of years. That would be just perfect as the underlying Objective-C stuff would still be there for compatibility&#39;s sake and performance where necessary. Go on Apple, you know you want to!</div><br /><div>Anyway, that mini-rant was not what I came here for. I&#39;ve been wrestling with the best way to name and use instance variables. Version 1 was to name them in no special way at all, but then you end up with confusion between properties and the underlying variable and also with methods that want to use a parameter with the same sensible name (as is often the case with init methods):</div><br /><div><span style="font-size: 12px;

Some purists argue that it&#39;s worth encapsulating with a property and always using that property. This way you can change your underlying data types but potentially retain the same property methods without breaking the code that uses them - i.e. it&#39;s an extra layer of abstraction that protects you from breaking changes. A few years ago I might have bought that, but these days I only add in layers of abstraction when they&#39;re truly needed, so I will use the property for external access and the instance var directly for internal access (though I&#39;ll always assign to the property to ensure retain counts are correct). I can easily refactor to add in the abstraction if necessary at a later point, but if I don&#39;t need it now then I won&#39;t bother with it.</div></div>

I tend to prefix my instance variables with 'm_', or just 'm' so I end up with 'm_Name' (I'm not a fan of underscores, but they're very clear). This makes it nice and easy to see what's a member of the class, and what's local to the method I'm working in.

You should always access your instance variables via setters, getters or properties - only in init and dealloc should you do anything with your instance variables directly. My advice with properties and the dot syntax is that if you're going to use it, stick with it for everything - don't alternate between standard [self setBlah:...]; and self.blah = ...;

You shouldn't use "_" to prefix your instance variables since those are reserved for use by Apple. See: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocLanguageSummary.html">http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Articles/ocLanguageSummary.html</a>

Actually it's just method names for which Apple reserves underscore prefixing. In my example, the instance variable has an underscore, but the synthesised accessor method does not, so this is OK.

Myself, I don't write stuff like this:

- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)name

I use this instead:

- (id)initWithName:(NSString *)newName

avoids the compiler issue, saves a lot of (unnecessary) awkward _'s

I agree with Tony Arnold, only use instance variables directly in init or dealloc's.  The reason do it directly in init methods, is that at the point of initialization, sometimes an accessor method will have some kind of dependance on another instance variable that is not yet initialized (ex; for parameter checking, validation etc).  So you need to get the object set up without having to run into those dependancies.  Using instance variables directly elsewhere can cause you to inadvertently bypass internal logic though, so you don't want to do that outside of init/dealloc

C# has nowhere near the elegance of obj-c imho.  Invocations, Message Forwarding, KVO, Notifications etc. are extremely powerful features.  I don't see that in C#/.NET. Not to mention all the insane overloads...good grief.  Talk about clunky.  And the .NET frameworks look like a major ripoff of Cocoa. (The only horror I see in obj-c is the dot syntax!)

BODY:
<div>My favourite Ruby web application framework&#0160;<a href="http://ramaze.net/" target="_blank">Ramaze</a>&#0160;has been updated, and in a major way. As of the 2009.05 gem release Ramaze is built on top of sub-project Innate - a lean mean core that in turn builds on top of Rack. Pistos explains the major changes well in <a href="http://blog.purepistos.net/index.php/2009/05/06/ramaze-200905-released/" target="_blank">his blog post</a>. For me, although I&#39;m yet to properly get to grips with the new code, the most promising things to look forward to are:</div><div><ul>
<li>A fresh start with a lot of accumulated cruft thrown out, resulting in cleaner, more straightforward code for Ramaze itself. I end up reading the Ramaze code a lot (it&#39;s very accessible and empowering) so this makes it even easier to delve into the internals and figure out what&#39;s what.</li>
<li><span>Rack middleware is front and centre, making it easy to chain HTTP processing components into your request handling flow - like Java servlet filters.</span>&#0160;Not required very often, but a godsend when it is.</li>
<li><span>A much tidier sessions implementation, with lazy&#0160;</span>initialisation.</li>
<li>A rethought render helper that brings a bit more sanity to the many ways to bring in view fragments.</li>
<li>Layout support is more of a core concern, with more facilities to deal with layouts sensibly.</li>
<li><span>Built-in support for serving different content representations</span>&#0160;from the same controller.</li>
<li><span>An interesting new codebase for me to poke my nose into :-)</span>&#0160;</li>
</ul>
<span>Now if only I can find time to get my Ramaze CRUD framework going in this new world order, then package it up to share with the rest of the world. One day!</span><br /></div>

<div>Mac OS X comes with a lot of fantastic stuff built-in, like Java, Ruby, Python etc. The downside to this is that users tend to stick with the stock installs of those items and never upgrade them, which can leave them a long way behind the curve. I just ran into that problem when trying to install the latest version of <a href="http://ramaze.net" target="_blank">Ramaze</a> (my favourite Ruby web application framework) from the official gems. The IRC channel #ramaze was useful as always and provided the solution. The problem is that rubygems on OSX 10.5 is old and tired, but you can tell it to install a very specific version of innate that sorts it out. So from scratch, assuming Mac OS X 10.5 with the stock Ruby 1.8.6 install:</div><div><br /><span style="font-family: Courier;">&gt; sudo gem install innate -v 2009.04<br /></span><span><span style="font-family: Courier;">&gt; sudo gem install ramaze</span></span><br /></div><br /><div>Obviously as new versions of innate and ramaze come out, the exact version of innate required will change. You can tell which verison you need by trying the ramaze install and looking at the error message.</div><br /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> Actually now Ramaze and Innate 2009.05 have been released, it seems things work just fine without any special incantations. So you can just <span style="font-family: Courier;">sudo gem install ramaze</span> and you&#39;re away.</div>

Do you get any gem issues with Leopard?  Ruby never seems to be able to find them.

I'm using Leopard and apart from being a bit old, Rubygems works as you'd hope. You have to remember to require 'rubygems' in your code of course, in 1.8.6.

<div>On the way back from a lovely wedding in Shropshire over the bank holiday weekend, we stopped off at <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-attinghampark" target="_blank">Attingham Park</a> - a National Trust property comprising a big house and a bigger estate. We got there fairly early in the day, and since the house isn&#39;t open to the massed hordes until 1pm we snuck on a free tour at 11. This turned out to be an unexpected delight, as the tour was specifically about the usually hidden process of keeping a big old NT house clean throughout the seasons. I didn&#39;t realise quite how much careful effort goes in every day just to keep dust at bay, not to mention light, insects and humidity.</div><br /><div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156f769a58970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="AttinghamPillars 6606" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401156f769a58970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156f769a58970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>&#0160;<br /></div><br /><div>To me the house isn&#39;t the star attraction here though (we went back and had a full look once it was properly open).

<div>Stuck for something for dinner and late home from work this evening I picked up a complete bargain at Iceland: £1 for a pack of two Chicago Town &quot;The Deep Dish&quot; pepperoni pizzas.

And the near centimetre deep layer of mozzarella? Missing in action. Don&#39;t get me wrong - still a bargain for £1 and damn tasty with it - but they&#39;ve stuck their neck on the block here and should reap the scorn deserved.</div><br /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> I sent an email to the customer service department who have responded to ensure me that the batch in question did not record any anomalies, so my disappointingly topped pizza must have been a one-off. That must go for all four pizzas in the two boxes I bought! They&#39;ve sent me a voucher for a free pizza to ease the pain. Fair enough, but this is clearly a stock response and I suspect they know full well it wasn&#39;t a one off and that their pizzas are always a long way from meeting the promise on the box. Cynical, moi? Can I be bothered to continue to kick up a fuss? I don&#39;t think that big corporations should be able to get away with this sort of blatant deceit and disrespect for the customer, but it&#39;s just not worth it.</div>

BODY:
<div>Many people don&#39;t know about Apache Bench, even though it may be installed on their system. For instance it&#39;s installed on Mac OS X by default. It&#39;s a very simple command line utility to perform basic stress/performance testing of websites. It can request a given URL repeatedly, then report back statistics. I generally use it in this form:</div><br /><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&gt; ab -n 100 -c 4 http://www.somewebsite.com/test/page.htm</span></div><br /><div>Dissecting that command:</div><div><ul>
<li>ab is the Apache Bench executable itself (found in /usr/sbin on my machine)</li>
<li><span>-n 100 tells it to send the request 100 times</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span>-c 4 tells it to use 4 concurrent threads to do so</span></li>
<li><span>finally we have the URL itself.</span>&#0160;</li>
</ul>
Even though it&#39;s simple, there are some important gotchas worth knowing about:</div><div><ul>
<li>Remember to put the URL in single quotes if it contains characters that would otherwise be interpreted by the shell. This is often the case for any URL with a query string, as the &amp; characters will mess things up otherwise.&#0160;</li>
<li><span>If using a base URL for a site (just host name), you must use a trailing slash. http://foo.com doesn&#39;t work, but http://foo.com/ does work.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span>Quite often you may see in the statistics &quot;Failed requests: 5&quot; or similar, followed by a list of the types of failure: &quot;(Connect: 0, Receive: 0, Length: 5, Exceptions: 0)&quot;. If the only type of failure that actually occurred is &#39;Length&#39; then don&#39;t be alarmed. This simply means that each request (for the same URL) returned a different length response, which ab regards as suspicious. However it&#39;s perfectly normal for dynamic webpages, especially if they include the time or other very dynamic data on the page.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span>I find on one of my machines that it just doesn&#39;t like localhost as a hostname, so I have to use 127.0.0.1 instead. I have no idea why, as localhost works fine in other contexts on the same machine.</span>&#0160;</li>
</ul>

BODY:
<div>Over the last ten years or so I&#39;ve increasingly been drawn to conclude that 1973 was a cracking year for music, and much underrated by the establishment. Here&#39;s why (and of course many of these artists released whole albums full of their best works):</div><div><ul>
<li>David Bowie - Life on Mars</li>
<li>Elton John - Crocodile Rock</li>
<li>Roberta Flack -&#0160;Killing Me Softly With His Song</li>
<li>Carly Simon -&#0160;You&#39;re So Vain</li>
<li>Bobby &quot;Boris&quot; Pickett - Monster Mash&#0160;</li>
<li><span>Wings - Live and Let Die</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span>Stevie Wonder - Superstition</span></li>
<li>Lou Reed -&#0160;Walk On The Wild Side</li>
<li><span>Paul Simon - Kodachrome</span>&#0160;</li>
<li>Eric Weissburg &amp; Steve Mandell&#0160;- Duelling Banjos</li>
<li><span>Doobie Brothers - Long Train Running</span>&#0160;</li>
<li>Stealers Wheel - Stuck In The Middle With You</li>
<li>Money - Pink Floyd</li>
<li><span>Alice Cooper - No More Mr Nice Guy</span>&#0160;</li>
<li><span>The Who -&#0160;</span>Quadrophenia</li>
</ul>
<span>It seems that I&#39;m not the only one to think this mind you, with plenty of posts in forums out there arguing the same point. 1977 and 1971 are also very popular years from the 1970s. I should point out that I wasn&#39;t even born in those years, so I&#39;m not simply harking back to my formative years!</span>&#0160;<br /><ul>
</ul>

<div>To complete today&#39;s beer review triumvirate, a fantastic find from the supermarket shelves (Sainsburys I think, but I&#39;m not completely sure). This is a near perfect bottle of loveliness, beautifully balanced with just a hint of sweet maple coming through to make it special. I can see why it won a silver medal in an international competition a couple of years back. I&#39;m annoyed that I only seem to have bought one bottle. I will seek out more, to check that it really is as great as I thought the first time round.<div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401157053c5f3970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="MapleMoon 6559" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401157053c5f3970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401157053c5f3970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> <br /></div></div></div>

<div>This is a good honest ale with a long history. In a can it&#39;s cheap but tasty, and certainly you get more from it than most of its competitors. It really is a &quot;premium ale&quot; as it says on the can, but at 4.5% it&#39;s not going to knock your block off, which is fine by me. Increasingly I find myself happy to pay a bit more for this over something simpler and weaker like Greene King IPA.

BODY:
<div>I&#39;m getting better at keeping those supermarket pots of fresh herbs alive and well on the kitchen windowsill. The trick is to repot them into a larger pot with some half-decent compost. However I always seem to be undone by aphid infestations. I have a lovely bushy basil plant right now but it&#39;s literally crawling with aphids so I suppose it&#39;ll have to go in the bin. Either that or I accept that the basil on my pasta will be contributing protein as well as leafy goodness.</div><br /><div>At least it makes an interesting subject for some macro photography! So it&#39;s out with the Sigma 105mm macro lens and my tripod and away we go. I have a couple of tips to impart, with photographic evidence to back them up.</div><br /><div>When you&#39;re doing macro work the tiniest movement can ruin the photo. And I do mean the tiniest amount of movement. On the left is a photo taken by simply pressing the shutter button, which has come out disappointingly blurry, whereas on the right I&#39;ve used both a 5 second self-timer and a delayed exposure: a feature of the Nikon D300 where the mirror goes up then it waits another second or so before actually taking the picture. Note that both these shots are taken with a sturdy tripod and the same exposure settings (1/10s, f11).</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156f4a27e6970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="AphidMacroComparison" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401156f4a27e6970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156f4a27e6970c-800wi" title="AphidMacroComparison" /></a> <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">The picture on the right is clearly sharper. This is because the vibrations from my hand pressing the shutter button and from the reflex mirror flipping out of the way have had time to die down before the picture was taken. This is a crop at 50%, so there&#39;s even more detail to be had at 100%. A good way to appreciate the ever-present vibrations, even when working on a tripod, is to turn on Live View on the camera and zoom right in to 100%. You can see the jitter due to vibration right on the LCD screen of your DSLR, and just how much it is affected by simply touching the camera or tripod.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Here&#39;s another shot, with an evil looking beastie in the middle and a cute little one at the bottom.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401157040ae8f970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BasilAphids 6552" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401157040ae8f970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401157040ae8f970b-450wi" style="width: 450px; " /></a> <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">[Incidentally, this is clearly the best title for a blog post I&#39;ve ever come up with.]</div>

<div>Finally, to finish off my posts on Rye Meads nature reserve, the butterflies. It was a beautiful spring day and there were a fair few about, mostly the species shown below. I took all of these photos with an 80-400mm zoom lens at the 400mm end which can only focus about 6.5 feet away as a minimum. I think they&#39;ve come out remarkably well, and this approach has the advantage of not having to get really close to the butterfly, scaring it off as you might with a macro lens. Maybe I&#39;ve stumbled into a brilliant new butterfly photography technique! Remember that as always you can click on any photo for a larger version.<div><br /><div>This is a Comma butterfly, notable for the shapely edge to its wing. It&#39;s known as a Comma because of the small comma shaped mark on the underside of the wing, but you&#39;ll rarely see that.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011570404596970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="RyeMeadButteflyComma 6485" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834011570404596970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011570404596970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> <br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Next, an Orange-tip butterfly on a Dandelion. The name is fairly self-explanatory. For the plant as well frankly.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401157040467c970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="RyeMeadButteflyOrangeTip 6486" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401157040467c970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401157040467c970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a> <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">And finally a Peacock butterfly, with the classic eyes on the wings to scare off predators.

<div>I <a href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2009/04/16/a-lovely-little-clock-with-a-single-fuction/" target="_blank">saw this and smiled</a>.

Only one downside - accidentally knock it without realising, or more likely have a&#0160;mischievous friend knock it deliberately -&#0160;and you&#39;ll be an hour out. So I&#39;d be tempted to add &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot; or some neat icons along the flat edges to make it obvious what setting it&#39;s currently on.

<div>Bank holiday Monday and it looked like the skies might clear for the first time in the long four day weekend. So off we drove to <a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/reserves/guide/r/ryemeads/index.asp" target="_blank">Rye Meads wildlife reserve</a>&#0160;near Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire - a slightly strange split between RSPB and Herts and Middlesex Wildlife Trust. It&#39;s also right next to the Rye House go-karting track where Lewis Hamilton apparently learnt his craft, and I&#39;ve been karting many a time. So I can highly recommend this spot on at least two counts!</div><br /><div>Just a very quick report for now: it&#39;s a fairly large place with loads of lagoons, ditches, reed beds, ponds etc. and 11 hides from which to look out for interesting things. A couple of notables below (but more to come).</div><br /><div>First up, a lone Redshank.

We used to live near there, we spent many a weekend looking for Kingfishers only to be told there were any anymore! Since then I've seen lots in Verulamium Park.
Did you see all the cormorants too?

They have an artificial bank for kingfishers to nest in at Rye Meads. Spent a while watching it, but no joy. I've seen plenty of kingfishers in St Albans though, along the Ver and at the WWA. I've got quite a few pictures of them on this blog. The best one is <a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/2009/02/has-spring-sprung.html">http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/2009/02/has-spring-sprung.html</a>

<div>It was a bit of a miserable grey day today, punctuated with rain. So an imperfect opportunity for a stroll to Verulam Park in St Albans, but we went anyway.

Hello :)

Oh wow!  What lovely pictures.

I live about 40 mins from St Albans so must take the time to come and see the herons!

If you come to St. Albans it's also worth climbing the hill and looking around the inside of the Abbey, which is a large and fascinating building.

<div>I&#39;ve seen quite a number of MobileMe sync problems over the last couple of months. Some items that I add/delete/modify in my calendar don&#39;t make the jump between laptop and desktop, or vice versa. It&#39;s completely intermittent and always works perfectly if I deliberately try to catch it out. This is extremely unhelpful of it, as it means I just can&#39;t trust my calendar on either machine to be correct.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156f08936e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Picture 7" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401156f08936e970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156f08936e970c-800wi" title="Picture 7" /></a>&#0160;<a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156f08936e970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><br /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div>I&#39;ve found a way to at least get things back in sync (as far as I can tell without doing an exhaustive comparison) though it remains to be seen whether it will actually stop things going wrong again. On all machines, open the iSync application, open its Preferences, then click the &quot;Reset sync history...&quot; button, and select &quot;Merge&quot; when asked. It might ask several times, for various types of sync data, with big spinny-arrow pauses in-between. You&#39;re putting yourself in the hands of MobileMe&#39;s sync algorithms here, so don&#39;t come crying to me if it makes your kettle fur up with scale and your cat leave home. I&#39;ll update this post as and when I determine if the more general problem is licked. Sadly my gut feeling is that it&#39;s too much to hope.</div><br /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> Still been having problems and have been tearing my hair out. The recent OS X 10.5.7 update promises some sync improvements though isn&#39;t specific about what. I&#39;m hopeful, but I won&#39;t know for a couple of months as it usually picks just one or two important items to not sync every now and then. Enough to keep me on my toes.</div>

The best bet when you're having sync problems really isn't to "merge", but to take the latest copy from a desktop machine and replace ALL information in the cloud.  Then let it propogate back down.  Also, on each machine, you should reset the sync history.  That is the real problem.

Resetting the sync history is exactly what I did on each machine. I merged because I was aware that it has failed to pass data in both directions so neither machine had a fully correct set of data.

<div>I&#39;ve endeavoured to rely on NetBeans&#39; auto-formatting feature before now, but I&#39;ve never been able to configure it quite to my tastes. In particular I had struggled to get rules for braces and line wrapping setup how I wanted for Java, with them almost always on a new line. I&#39;m not sure whether I had simply failed to find the right options or if they&#39;re new in 6.5.1 or another recent release.</div><br /><div>It&#39;s perfect for cleaning up code that you&#39;re copying and pasting from the web, taking the labour out of it. All I need now in NetBeans is a less&#0160;tedious way of generating getters and setters that requires less mouse clicks, remembers your last preferences (put at end of file, no comments) and can have m_ prefix on the vars but not the accessor method names.</div><br /><div>That said, better still would be for Java to grow up a bit and gain a better way to do boiler plate accessors.

BODY:
<div>I bought a pack of these unpretentious cans on holiday in Cornwall, as there wasn&#39;t much choice in the small Co-op. I could have had John Smiths Extra Smooth, but I&#39;m not a fan of the smooth creamy head on my pint. It&#39;s shame that Cornwall seems to be one of those areas that puts the cream-flow spouts on their draught beer taps, like they do up North. A classic way to ruin a perfectly good pint if you ask me.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156eed1f07970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="JohnSmithsOriginal 6348" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401156eed1f07970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401156eed1f07970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">There&#39;s not much to say for this very straightforward bitter - it&#39;s got good colour and a decent enough flavour, but it&#39;s very one-dimensional with pretty much zero in the way of extra interesting tastes coming through other than the basic bitterness. A good cheap beer to keep in for light mid-week requirements, but I find <a href="/atc/2008/11/beer-review-greene-king-ipa-can.html">Greene King IPA</a> fills that role better.</div>

<div>Spurred on by <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2009/03/23/rubys-biggest-challenge-for-2009/" target="_blank">Antonio Cangiano&#39;s recent campaign</a>, I&#39;ve been trying to make a permanent move to Ruby 1.9.1. I&#39;ve been on 1.8.6 by default for a good while, as that&#39;s what you get with Mac OS X 10.5, though it&#39;s actually not too hard to get going compiling your own Ruby from source - no special tricks are required and it works great. I hope Apple makes 1.9.x the default for OS X 10.6 when it appears later this year. Go on - be brave!</div><br /><div>So what have I found in this exciting new world?</div><div><ul>
<li>It&#39;s a bit faster, as expected, though nothing to get especially excited about.</li>
<li><span>Some very popular gems just don&#39;t work straight off the shelf. Mongrel for instance - though I&#39;m told it&#39;s really easy to get it working with a couple of tweaks. Still, it&#39;s a shame for the sake of the community that the official latest gem can&#39;t have those tweaks made to it and save a lot of people an awful lot of fuss. Actually I hear that Mongrel 2 is on the way, taking advantage of more of Rack&#39;s infrastructure. I look forward to it.</span>&#0160;</li>
<li>ri now works really quickly compared to my 1.8.6 install, which always thinks for a couple of seconds before giving me a result. I think this is due to a new caching mechanism that was introduced around 1.8.7. Simple things like this make a huge difference to my life!</li>
<li><span>ri actually finds docs for the standard libraries, which it didn&#39;t for my 1.8.7 install. I think was due to some issue in the standard makefile for 1.8.7, but I&#39;m not really sure. Again, for someone like me who only just knows what he&#39;s doing, this makes a huge difference.</span></li>
<li><span>Proper string encoding support! Finally the promised land, as long as you can take the hit of string indexing now being incredibly slow.</span></li>
<li><span>Rubygems at 1.3.1, which is much more refined than that bundled with ruby 1.8.6 on Mac OS X. You can get this for yourself on any version of Ruby with gem update --system BTW.</span>&#0160;No more &quot;<span style="font-family: arial; line-height: normal; ">Bulk updating Gem source&quot;.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>I recommend everyone tries to move on up, at least with a parallel install that they can easily switch, and applies pressure to the holdouts to get it happening. Commercial pressures will make it tough for many, but when we break on through to the other side it will all be worth it I reckon.</span>&#0160;<br /></div>

BODY:
<p><strong>Update:</strong>&#0160;There&#0160;is&#0160;a&#0160;new&#0160;effort&#0160;to&#0160;create&#0160;a&#0160;decent&#0160;Windows&#0160;Ruby&#0160;installer. You can get the new downloadable installers from&#0160;<a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/" target="_blank">http://rubyinstaller.org/</a> though as of August 2009 these are still in preview form. It seems from my brief experiment that you&#39;ll still have to set your PATH manually, as per my manual instructions below. This installer also promises a faster Ruby as it builds using superior tools, so might well be worthwhile if only for that. Below are my original manual instructions for installing Ruby on Windows, which should still be just as valid as they always were. The installer is probably worth a look though.</p>

<p>The following worked for me on Windows XP, but maybe I&#39;m yet to run into problems I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve got:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Download the Windows binary release from&#0160;<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/" target="_blank">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/</a></li>
<li>Unzip it, in my case to C:\ruby191\</li>
<li><span>Also download readline.dll (e.g. from <a href="http://www.econsultant.com/dll-database-r/readline.dll-download.html" target="_blank">http://www.econsultant.com/dll-database-r/readline.dll-download.html</a>) and put the DLL in C:\ruby191\bin</span></li>
<li><span>Put C:\ruby191\bin and C:\ruby191\lib on your PATH</span></li>
</ul>
<span>That got ruby working in a basic sense for me, but I wasn&#39;t able to install gems. If I tried, I got two errors in sequence:&#0160;&quot;</span><span style="font-style: italic;">The ordinal 277 could not be located in the dynamic link library SSLEAY32.dll</span><span>&quot; and &quot;</span><span style="font-style: italic;">This application has failed to start because zlib.dll was not found.</span><span>&quot;</span><p></p>

<br /><p>The ssleay32.dll problem was solved by getting hold of a couple of DLLs and putting them in the right place, as follows:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Download &quot;Win32 OpenSSL v0.9.8k Light&quot; from <a href="http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html" target="_blank">http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html</a>.</li>
<li><span>Run the installer, but take note of the following:</span></li>
<li>You can ignore any initial warning about not having Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables.</li>
<li>You can ignore any warnings about command prompts being open.</li>
<li><span>Install to somewhere like C:\OpenSSL - it doesn&#39;t really matter, we just need a couple of DLLs.</span></li>
<li><span>When prompted, choose to Copy OpenSSL DLLS to The OpenSSL binaries (/bin) directory.</span></li>
<li><span>Once the installer has completed, you can go to C:\OpenSSL\bin (or wherever you installed it) and copy the two files ssleay32.dll and libeay32.dll to your Ruby bin directory, C:\ruby191\bin in my case.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>The zlib.dll problem was solved by in much the same way:</span><p></p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Download the compiled zlib 1.2.3 DLL from&#0160;<a href="http://www.zlib.net/" target="_blank">http://www.zlib.net/</a> (about two thirds of the way down the page).</li>
<li><span>Unzip it to get the zlib1.dll file.</span></li>
<li><span>Put that file in your Ruby bin directory, but rename it to zlib.dll</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Et voila - gems can now be installed successfully! Note that you may have had copies of some of these DLLs in your \WINDOWS\system32 directory already (I certainly did) but the problem is that they are too old. I prefer to put the newer ones directly in the Ruby bin directory, so only Ruby picks them up and it can&#39;t break anything else on the system.</span><p></p>

This was a helpful post to me.  I also wanted to comment that all three of the missing files (and the readline.dll which gave me errors running irb) are in the Instant Rail distribution and can be copied from there.

You need to set the Windows environment variable PATH to include the directory where the Ruby binaries are installed. This PATH lists the directories that Windows should search when trying to find an executable, so that (for instance) when you type "ruby someapp.rb" on the command line, it knows where the 'ruby' executable is. I suggest that you Google for "setting windows PATH environment" or similar.

Hi this is a great article. Only thing -- I had to change zlib1.dll to zlib.dll. When I typed "gem list" it told me it could not find zlib.dll. So I changed file name and it worked.

The one click installer is being done away with. The method is much cleaner. If the DLLs were already in place it would be a snap but Ruby installed and working is a pain but so worth it!!!

If you install Ruby 1.9.1 on Windows 7 64 bit, then you should get the .dlls from the   OpenSSL 64-bin version also.

Also make sure that you download version 0.98 of "Win32 OpenSSL v0.9.8k Light" and NOT version 1.0. I tried version 1.0 and when enterting "require 'resolv'" I got an error about "Ordinal 132 could not be found in Dynamic Link Library SSLEAY32.dll" or something like that. Then I installed the 0.98 version and copied the DLLs over to Ruby's bin directory and it worked fine.

I assumed it was duff batteries, though I&#39;d normally get a warning a good while before they conk out completely. Changed them, but still no dice. I attached a wired mouse and did some digging - basically Bluetooth no longer seemed to exist on my Mac! The menubar widget claimed bluetooth was &#39;not available&#39; and the System Preferences Panel said similar. Restarting didn&#39;t help - in fact it made the menubar widget and System Preferences Panel disappear entirely!</p><br /><div>After a bit of digging on the web, what worked for me was to reset PRAM. Shutdown computer, then start it up whilst holding down cmd-option-P-R until it chimes a second time. Actually I held down until a third chime for good luck. Seems to have done the trick!</div><br /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update:</span> It then failed again shortly afterwards. Next move was to delete a critical prefs file. Best not to do this unless you have a clue what it means:</div><div><ul>
<li>sudo mv /var/root/Library/Preferences/blued.plist ~/Desktop/</li>
</ul>
At the same time I shutdown the computer, removed all attached cables, opened it up and pressed the PMU/SMC reset button down near the RAM (this is a PowerMac G5 tower) then restarted. It seems to be OK for now. It did mean the clock resetting to 1970 and me having to wait for all my iCal notifications to stream in once I&#39;d reset to 2009.<br /><br /></div><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 2:</span> And it&#39;s gone again. Maybe it&#39;ll never be back. I swear if Apple sold some sort of mid-tower machine - somewhere between an iMac (but without a screen) and the Mac Pro, I&#39;d buy one without a second&#39;s hesitation. I&#39;ve been waiting for years for this machine, on the assumption that it&#39;s an obvious hole in their line-up and will be along any moment, but I&#39;ve been hideously disappointed.</div><br /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 3:</span> It seems that if I shutdown the computer rather than simply restarting, my bluetooth comes back to life. At the moment it&#39;s been fine for all of today, but it might flake out on me at a moment&#39;s notice for all I know.</div><br /><div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Update 4</span>: Correction - resetting PRAM by holding down cmd-opt-P-R until you hear a second chime is vital. Simply shutting down and restarting does not seem to do it. At the moment I sometimes get a few days of successful use between failures.</div>

<p>I&#39;ve been experimenting with Ruby 1.9.1 and trying to make it my natural home recently. Crucial to that was getting the mysql gem installed. Actually it&#39;s fairly straightforward with the 2.8.1 version of the gem and only very minor mods to the official instructions at&#0160;<a href="http://www.tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby/" target="_blank">http://www.tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby/</a> were required.</p><br /><div>Note that I have only tried this to work against MySQL 5.0.x, which I have installed in /usr/local/mysql, as all my previous attempts to use MySQL 5.1 have failed miserably and I&#39;ve given up on that for now. These instructions install from source, resulting in a fresh&#0160;/usr/local/ruby191/lib/ruby/site_ruby/1.9.1/mysql.bundle. Then you can simply require &#39;mysql&#39; in your Ruby code and you&#39;re away.</div><br /><div><div><ul>
<li>Downloaded 2.8.1 source tgz from RubyForge, linked from <a href="http://www.tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby" target="_blank">http://www.tmtm.org/en/mysql/ruby</a>/ downloads section.</li>
<li>Expanded the tgz with Finder, then opened a command prompt...</li>
<li>&gt; cd mysql-ruby-2.8.1</li>
<li>&gt; ruby extconf.rb --with-mysql-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config -with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql</li>
<li>&gt; make</li>
<li>&gt; sudo make install</li>
</ul>
</div><div>Et voila! Note that make did output a bunch of warnings about implicit 64/32 bit conversion that suggests the code isn&#39;t entirely 64 bit happy, but I&#39;ve not observed any problems as a result. Yet.</div><br /></div>

Thanks for the info. Regarding MySQL 5.1, the 2.8.1 mysql gem works with it fine. Here's the set up I'm using:

$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.1.36, for apple-darwin9.7.0 (powerpc) using  EditLine wrapper

$ ruby --version
ruby 1.9.1p243 (2009-07-16 revision 24175) [powerpc-darwin9.7.0]

$ gem --version
1.3.4

Note that I'm not using the rubygems that came with ruby 1.9.1 (I installed rubygems as noted <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/view/ruby-rails-leopard">here</a> before learning that ruby 1.9.1 included it).

BODY:
I advise every programmer out there to read lots of other people's code. Pick an open source project that you're a fan of (and perhaps use every day), download the source and then sit and try and figure out how it works. You may find the following things:<div><ul>
<li>It's interesting to see how other people write code, from their specific syntactic style to the level of commenting, overall design and code layout, common idioms etc. You'll probably learn something - either good things that you can copy, or bad things that are tough to read and warn you off doing the same.</li>
<li><span>You may find the code frustrating and difficult to figure out, not only initially but no matter who long you work through it, though if that's the case then it's probably poor code. Hopefully that will influence how you write your own code, for the better.</span>&nbsp;</li>
<li>If it is a product that you use regularly, you may gain insights into what it's really doing and how, that empower you to use it more effectively. You may even be able to modify it to make some improvement that matters to you.</li>
<li>Once you've got past the initial difficulty and started to understand things, you acquire a sense of power. No longer are these complicated pieces of software opaque and mysterious. They can be broken down, understood and messed with. A whole world of possibilities opens up and you no longer need to be afraid.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<span>I've recently been reading the <a href="http://github.com/manveru/innate/tree/master" target="_blank">Ruby source code of Innate</a> - the new underpinnings of next generation <a href="http://ramaze.net" target="_blank">Ramaze</a>,&nbsp;a Ruby web app framework that I particularly enjoy using. Innate is built on top of <a href="http://rack.rubyforge.org/" target="_blank">Rack</a>, so I've been reading that too. The mystery is ebbing away and it's making me more powerful. Stand back! :-)</span><br></div>

BODY:
<p>It&#39;s easy to just pull out the big non-stick half-wok half-frying pan thing for most meals that involve frying anything (especially if you&#39;re going to add liquid later as its high sides mean a good overall capacity), but it&#39;s not always best. A good stainless steel thick-bottomed frying pan has some important qualities that you&#39;re missing out on. In particular you&#39;ll be missing out on building a layer of tasty brown fried-on stuff as you do your onions and meat, which you can then de-glaze into the sauce as you add liquid. In a non-stick pan that just doesn&#39;t really happen.
</p>
<p>We got a great deal on a set of Prestige stainless steel cookware a couple of years back and it&#39;s been a real eye opener. My biggest worry was that it would be a complete pain to wash up, but this really isn&#39;t the case at all. Generally things don&#39;t stick much anyway, and a short soak soon sorts out even the worst offence. And they look dead professional :-)</p>

BODY:
<div>I was overjoyed to see the new March 22nd First Capital Connect Thameslink timetable, which seems to have a straight flush of 8 car trains from St Albans into London in the morning rush hour! There are also more 8 car trains coming back out in the evening than there were, but they don&#39;t seem to have managed to cover all services.</div>
<br />
<div>That would have been it for this post, but my wife told me that she&#39;d had a letter from FCC saying that the new trains required to do this are actually four months late (cue obvious jokes) and so we&#39;ll be lucky to actually see this working out in reality. Either that or they will try to manage it with yet more borrowed stock from Southern, but cunningly setup such that the first minor problem wrecks everything through lack of contingency capacity. Brilliant.</div>
<br />
<div>I still find it highly amusing that there&#39;s all this talk of 12 car trains when they still can&#39;t run anything better than 4 car trains for many rush hour services. Let&#39;s get to 8 first!</div>
<br />
<div>Incidentally, is there an even more disgruntled commuter somewhere in the deep South wondering why they now have 1 car trains, by virtue of all Southern&#39;s stock having been sent to FCC? Or did they just have all these trains sat in a shed waiting for their calling?!</div>

Well if the overcrowding on the southbound platforms at Blackfriars this evening is anything to go by there may well be quite a few extra people now having to use FCC to travel south from there than there used to be following the withdrawal of all the other train services from the station! I'm pretty sure it won't be very long before the lack of trains causes pain to commuters.

BODY:
<p>One of the things in Cornwall that you have to visit by law is the Eden Project. It&#39;s quite pricey to get in (notably more than the Lost Gardens of Heligan for instance) and dare I say that rankled a bit. It&#39;s reputation precedes it, so it had a lot to live up to. To be honest it fell a little short, but that might be because we&#39;d been to Heligan just two days before which had set a high bar, and our expectation were a bit unrealistically set from all the media coverage that it gets.</p><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011279840d1228a4-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="EdenProjectBiomes 6317" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834011279840d1228a4 " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011279840d1228a4-450wi" style="width: 450px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">The two biomes are genuinely impressive and by far the best thing about the place. Set in an old quarry, they are sheltered from the elements and act as enormous greenhouses with the larger set housing a tropical climate and the other a cooler&#0160;Mediterranean&#0160;experience. It was a super-sunny day for March and the tropical biome was absolutely scorching. Sweat was dripping down every part of me. It was almost a chore, save for the extraordinary wealth of lush tropicana all around, including waterfalls, streams and millions of tiny ants. A member of staff told me that the ants and all the birdlife weren&#39;t really supposed to be there but there wasn&#39;t much they could do. I watched a robin catching a grasshopper, and another one eating a large cockroach! With those sorts of goods on offer I&#39;m not surprised they wait to come through the sliding doors with the rest of the visitors.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011279841fe328a4-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="EdenProjectTropicalBiome 6316" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834011279841fe328a4 " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011279841fe328a4-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>

 <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">The&#0160;Mediterranean&#0160;biome was probably my favourite bit, as it was a pleasant place to be in absolutely every sense, though not quite as vast and absorbing as the tropics. One building is known as The Core and at the centre of it is a 75 tonne sculpture hewn from a single piece of rock - apparently the largest single stone ever quarried in the UK. It&#39;s an egg or pine-cone shaped sculpture with highly geometric qualities that represents a seed pod at the core of the whole endeavour. I kind of liked it, but the building it was in, full of educational stuff, didn&#39;t quite seem to gel.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Overall, if you&#39;re going to Cornwall you&#39;d be mad not to visit the Eden project, but if it were much busier than it was in mid-March it might be a bit of a struggle. I think I&#39;d recommend people go, but I&#39;d even more strongly recommend they go to the Lost Gardens of Heligan nearby. More on that to come.</div>

<p>I&#39;ve always struggled to tell the difference between Rook, Crow and Raven, though I&#39;ve had Jackdaws sorted for years (notably smaller - black cap above more slightly silvery head and neck). To remedy this situation I&#39;ve really been trying to get to grips with the differences and positively identify large black birds over recent months.

 <br /></div><br /><div>This is fairly classicly an adult rook by virtue of the grey area around the base of the bill, which itself is long and pointy compared to that of a carrion crow. That said, the head shape seems more typically crow-like to me (less of a crown) and in this example there&#39;s no evidence of the &#39;baggy trousers&#39; that usually distinguishes a rook. As a result I&#39;m left still fairly puzzled, but I&#39;m going with my call that this is a rook. Furthermore, there were lots of them around all together and apparently this is a sign of rookedness.</div>

Our home for those few days of blissful weather was The Birdcage - a National Trust&#0160;holiday&#0160;cottage right in the heart of Port Isaac, literally stumbling distance from the pub. You might recognise Port Isaac from the ITV comedy/drama Doc Marting, starring Martin Clunes, though I understand it&#39;s been used for lots of other things too, because it&#39;s such a charming little spot.</p><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401116901f74e970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="PortIssacWide 6265" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401116901f74e970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401116901f74e970c-500wi" style="width: 500px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">You can just about see The Birdcage about half-way up above the red van in the image above, but there&#39;s a closer shot below. It&#39;s a pentagonal building with just a single room on each floor, bar the bathroom tacked onto the ground floor as an extension. Straight in off the street (though you&#39;d struggle to drive up a three foot wide 30 degree path) you&#39;re into the kitchen - compact but bijou. Then up a very steep, very narrow staircase to the lounge and then an even narrower staircase (about 15 inches across) to the bedroom. It was absolutely delightful, but the only way you can truly understand is to stay there yourself. I can recommend it.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011279760c5928a4-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="PortIssacBirdcage 6263" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834011279760c5928a4 " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011279760c5928a4-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>

<p>I&#39;ve been following the progress of MacRuby for a few months now and was looking forward to the next release. Finally, and a month or three after it was expected, MacRuby 0.4 is here, according to <a href="http://www.macruby.org/news/" target="_blank" title="MacRuby blog">the MacRuby blog</a>.</p><p>MacRuby is, to keep it simple, an implementation of Ruby 1.9 built in Objective-C with transparent calling between the ruby and Obj-C worlds. For instance Ruby Strings are actually NSStrings in MacRuby and have all the powers of both. This along with some other neat integrations provided by the team allow you to write Mac OS X Cocoa apps using Ruby instead of Obj-C, or even a combination of both. If like me you think that Obj-C is a dinosaur that doesn&#39;t deserve a place in the modern programming world, this is great news. There seems to be a lot of momentum behind this project and I wonder if it may eventually become quite a fully fledged citizen for Mac app programmers - maybe even ultimately taking over from Obj-C for most Mac OS X development. I can but hope.</p><p>One of the many neat improvements in 0.4 is the ability to bundle the MacRuby runtime into the app itself so the user need be none the wiser, and certainly doesn&#39;t need to install MacRuby.</p>

But it often clumps together on the plate and I thought it must be possible to do better.</p><br /><div>Delia&#39;s approach involves a large covered saucepan, no rinsing, just enough water, almost no stirring and a couple of important other tips. I&#39;d say that it &#39;worked&#39; but that it was still just rice at the end of the day and I&#39;m not sure it was worth it. Not having my usual rice alongside to compare with made it hard to know whether it was much of an improvement. I&#39;d post a picture of my result, but it would be really very dull.</div>

My mum gave me one that you stick in the microwave.

It sort of counts as cheating, but still.. rather nifty.

My lovely wife got me a set of four port sippers for my birthday recently. One of my brothers got me a bottle of a good vintage port, and I still have a vintage bottle from a friend&#39;s wedding where I was best man. All I need now is a decanter and I&#39;m go go go for a port party!</p><div><br /><div>I&#39;ve been wanting some of these sippers for years, since using some at a friend&#39;s house, but never actually finding them anywhere (internet or real world). It seems they&#39;re now freshly available and easy to find. They are delicate little handmade glass items, the idea being that you drink through the built-in straw, hence taking the liquid from the bottom rather than the top. Which is apparently a good thing, helping to &quot;avoid oxidisation and improve taste&quot;. Apart from that they&#39;re just neat little things that are out of the ordinary.</div><br />

BODY:
<p>I was running into an annoyance whereby I&#39;d end up with duplicated validation messages from ActiveRecord. I tracked this down to the source reload feature of <a href="http://ramaze.net" target="_blank" title="Ramaze - Ruby web application framework">Ramaze</a>, which was reloading my AR model classes each time I edited them with the dev server running, which has the unfortunate side effect of adding the validators again on top of the same ones that were there before. So each reload adds another set of validators and another duplicate validation message. This sort of thing (mainly class methods that add to a list) often requires special care when working with a source reloading system. In this case I&#39;ve worked around it by resetting AR&#39;s internal validator list to empty before creating my validators, by directly accessing the&#0160;@validate_callbacks instance variable. For example:</p><br /><div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">class Event &lt; ActiveRecord::Base</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;# Clear all AR validations, to avoid getting duplicates on source reload.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;@validate_callbacks = []</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;validates_presence_of :name</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;validates_presence_of :description</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">end</span></div></div>

<p>I&#39;ve been furiously porting my Ramaze CRUD helper from <a href="http://datamapper.org/" target="_blank" title="DataMapper Ruby ORM">DataMapper</a> to <a href="http://ar.rubyonrails.com/" target="_blank" title="ActiveRecord Ruby ORM">ActiveRecord</a> and I&#39;ve been quite surprised to find that it&#39;s only taken a couple of hours. I should hastily point out for non-programmer types, that CRUD stands for Create Read Update Delete - the four basic operations you can perform on a data entity.</p><br /><div>My helper makes it super-easy to produce basic CRUD web pages for any data entity, with just a couple of lines of code in your helper - a bit like Rails scaffolds but without the scaffolding! Sounds like magic, I hear you yell! Well yes, but it&#39;s my magic that I wrote from scratch so it&#39;s not magic to me :-)<br /><div>It&#39;s been an easy port between ORMs mostly because the concepts and syntax map over with relatively little fuss, and actually 98% of my CRUD helper code is not concerned with the DB, but rather with running the web UI. So the few places that actually perform a DB operation needed a bit of tweaking to use the right syntax, but it&#39;s been pretty smooth sailing. Hopefully it will be easier with AR to neatly deal with many-to-many associations without having to explicitly fool around with the join table. We shall see, as that&#39;s what foxed me with DataMapper and caused me to switch.</div><br /><div>One very important thing to mention is that when using ActiveRecord outside of Rails you have to know that it was originally written for the single-threaded Rails world. Hence it just maintains a very small connection pool (say 3) and those connections quickly run out in a threaded environment - Ramaze in my case. This leads to strange pauses of several seconds as your request handling thread waits for a connection to come free. They come free after about 5 seconds of inactivity, so you get one reasonably soon, but the multi-second pause is infuriating and very confusing. A neatly packaged solution is handily presented and well explained here:&#0160;<a href="http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/monkey-patching-activerecord-to-automatically-release-connections/" target="_blank">http://coderrr.wordpress.com/2009/01/16/monkey-patching-activerecord-to-automatically-release-connections/</a>. Note that there is a link at the bottom to the single-file patch that just sorts everything out for you, so if you can&#39;t be bothered to read the explanations, head straight for that, require it in your project and you&#39;re away.</div></div>

<p>This is quite a special lager - brewed with champagne yeast it has a very fine, light bubble and it does indeed taste like a beery champagne. Imagine a very fine champagne with the sweetness replaced with dry pils bitterness. Certainly the lingering feel in the mouth is more champagne than beer.</p><div>There are very few beers brewed in this style, so this one from Alsace is quite unique and worth tracking down. I was spurred to pick some up because Waitrose had 25% of the bottles - and it was on taste :-) It&#39;s really very good indeed - super refreshing and drinkable (but remember it&#39;s a deceptive 5.2% ABV) but a bit unusual.</div><br /><div>In this case I was drinking it from a&#0160;Kölsch glass, which isn&#39;t entirely right, but seemed to suit it&#39;s delicacy. I suppose it could/should be drunk from a champagne flute!</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011278db551228a4-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="KasteelCru" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834011278db551228a4 " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834011278db551228a4-350wi" style="width: 350px; " /></a>

This is a fine beer, and your glass is just fine!  If you check out the link above, you can see a picture of the Kasteel Cru in its own classy glass!  Really, a very good beer.  Go try it!

<div>The theory is good with the new buttonless MacBook trackpads, but in practice I think it's flawed. The whole very large surface clicks down when pushed, though it's hinged at the far side, so it works best at the side closest to the user. So you ought to be able to use your thumb to click exactly where the button used to be, and be no worse off than before. Problem is, the button was raised up a bit above the palmrest, whereas the tracking surface is a shade below it. So now your thumb has to reach down and over the lip to click, which is a bit uncomfortable. It's a subtle difference but I think an important one.</div><br><div>I've only had a play in the shop, so maybe I'd get used to it and maybe even change my clicking habits entirely, but it put me right off.</div>

Thanks for pointing me to the original wisdom that guides this API design choice. I can see the logic, but I don't find it any less frustrating that r = l.reverse() doesn't assign anything to r.

BODY:
<p>I ran into an interesting performance issue with my Google App Engine application, which I&#39;m currently developing feverishly. It seems that if you use indexed array style access to an unfetched Query object, performance is atrocious. I&#39;m fairly sure that it&#39;s doing a fetch for each access. It will also hit the &#39;DB&#39; if you call count() on the Query object. Far superior is to explicitly fetch() from the Query to get a list, then use that. It&#39;s all fairly obvious really, but it took me a while to realise what was going on, perhaps because you can innocuously use the Query object as an iterator without this problem, which lulls you into a false sense of security.</p><br /><div>So to give a contrived (and untested) example, this I would expect to be terrible performance wise:</div><br /><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">special_days = SpecialDay.all().filter(&#39;date &gt;=&#39;, start_date).order(&#39;date&#39;)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">day = date.today()</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">end_date = day + timedelta(21)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">sd_index = 0</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">while day &lt;= end_date:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160;# This count() call and the indexed access to special_days each cause a DB hit!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160;if special_days.count() &gt;&#0160;sd_index&#0160;and day == special_days[sd_index]:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;print &#39;special day&#39;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;special_days_index += 1</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160;else:</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;print &#39;ordinary day&#39;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160;day += timedelta(1)</span></div><br /><div>It&#39;s easily fixed by simply adding fetch(1000) on the end of the first line, and using len(special_days) instead of special_days.count(). Also, having moved to working with a list, you can remove sd_index entirely and pop() items off the front of special_days until it&#39;s empty instead. It&#39;s a pain that there isn&#39;t a less skanky way to fetch &#39;all of them&#39; without using that nasty 1000. I suppose at the very least I should create a MAX_FETCH_LIMIT constant for it in my own code, so I can centrally modify it when Google modify their max limit.<br /><br /><div>Why can&#39;t I just use an iterator anyway you may ask? Because my loop, which is similar in structure to the example above, is iterating over days between two dates and each time round the loop picking the item off the front of my list of data entities (which were fetched in date order) if it matches the day. It&#39;s all working very nicely now thanks, and I&#39;ve added caching too, to save hitting the DB at all in many cases.</div></div>

BODY:
<p>A funny thing appears to be happening in the mortgage market, and it&#39;s of precisely no help to me, seeing as I just want to buy a house to live in. First some facts to set the scene.</p><div><ul>
<li>Bank of England base rate here in the UK is down at 1%.</li>
<li>But you can&#39;t get a new mortgage with a rate any better than 5% if you only have a 15% deposit. That&#39;s the same rate you could get just 2 years ago, when the BoE base rate was 5.25% as far as I recall.</li>
<li>15% is a not unreasonable deposit by standards of recent years, and it&#39;s certainly a huge chunk of cash given the astronomical price of a three bed semi these days.</li>
<li>If you have a 40% deposit, you can get a new mortgage with a 2.29% rate.&#0160;</li>
<li>The price of houses is by the way still about double what it was just ten short years ago.</li>
</ul>
The net result of this is that people with vast stacks of money just sitting around in savings accounts are realising that they&#39;re not getting any interest on their stash and might be better off investing in bricks and mortar. Seeing as they have these giant piles of cash they can pay a 40% deposit no problem and take advantage of the seriously cheap mortgage deals available only to the already mega-rich. I&#39;m told by local estate agents that young folk are now streaming into their offices with their parents in tow (they supply the briefcase full of gold bars) to get their investment property sorted as a nice little earner.</div><br /><div>And guess what this influx does? Pushes up property prices, keeping the money-go-round spinning for those lucky enough to be on it. So, I put forward the bold statement that the decrease in base rates combined with the existing lack of credit is actually shutting non-investors out of the market. Which is really annoying because I was hoping for a cheap-houses-for-all feeding frenzy of which I could be a part :-(</div><br /><div>Of course, I&#39;m just bitter.</div>

<p>A cavalcade of beer today! But drunk last weekend in Vienna in holiday mood, with cold wintery weather outside.
</p><p>First, a warm bar called Centimeter, where many things (including sandwiches) were available by the centimeter. A Paulaner in its correct glass on the right, and I can&#39;t remember what the dunkel beer was on the left, other than this wasn&#39;t the correct glass for it. Both were delicious!

I tried the chilli beer, assuming that it would deliver a warm background glow of chilli heat but nothing more, otherwise they&#39;d struggle to sell much of it. I was wrong. This was throat scorching stuff and I probably wouldn&#39;t have another, but it was an interesting novelty experience.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340111685364c6970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="AustriaBeer2" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340111685364c6970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340111685364c6970c-350wi" style="width: 350px; " /></a>

<p>I&#39;ve stumbled across a real irritation with the way the Google App Engine data model works. One among many frankly, but I&#39;ll restrict myself to just this one for now.</p><div><br /><div>The issue stems from the fact that db.run_in_transaction(func) insists that func is a function with no side effects, since it may be run repeatedly in an attempt to get the transaction to go through (if optimistic locking fails). Fair enough, but that means it has to freshly fetch any model objects that it wants to modify, otherwise it would have side effects to objects outside its scope. But consider this situation, in which we have an increment() function on our model object, that must use a transaction because it also modifies other related objects at the same time and require atomic behaviour:</div><div><br /><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">class Person(db.Model):</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160;count = db.IntegerProperty(default=0, required=True)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160;def increment(self):</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;def tx():</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;# Mess with some other related objects in data store.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;&lt;omitted for brevity&gt;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;# Must fetch a separate copy of self to avoid side effects.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;person = db.get(self.key())</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;person.count += 1</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160; &#0160;person.put()</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;">&#0160;&#0160; &#0160;db.run_in_transaction(tx)</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Courier;"><br /></span></div><div>The problem here is that self hasn&#39;t actually been modified at all and is now out of date with respect to the data store (where the count is one bigger, assuming the transaction succeeded). This is a pain for the caller who had a Person object and called increment() on it and naturally expects their object&#39;s count to be one higher. But their object hasn&#39;t been modified at all - though the data store has, via the freshly fetched person. In case it&#39;s not obvious, we can&#39;t simply change the code above to use self instead of getting the new person object, since&#0160;db.run_in_transaction(tx)&#0160;may run our tx() function multiple times until it completes without an optimistic locking failure. If it did have to run multiple times, self&#39;s count would increment by one for each failed attempt, so the final successful attempt could end up with more than one added to the count. Or if the transaction eventually failed outright, self&#39;s count would still have been modified even though the data store had not been touched.</div><br /><div>So the only solutions I can see are:</div><div><ul>
<li>Put code after the run_in_transaction() call, that synchronises self with the data store. There isn&#39;t a sync() or refresh() method on Model objects, so you have to do this painstakingly by getting another fresh person with&#0160;db.get(self.key()) and then copying across just the fields you know might have changed.</li>
<li>Insist that the caller is aware that certain methods on the model objects won&#39;t modify the object itself so they need to get a fresh one. This completely wrecks the idea of an object model and encapsulation though. You&#39;d might as well just have a purely functional interface to the data store.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>It all seems like madness to me, that defeats the point of trying to have a neat, simple data storage object model. As usual, I can only hope that I&#39;ve missed some crucial point and that in fact the problem is easily and elegantly solved. I shall look out for that solution, unless some kind reader can enlighten me!</div></div></div>

Use a piece of this to define sync() for yourself, and you should be good to go. Just make sure to do sync() after the transaction finishes (using a closure, or something):


class MyModel(db.Model):
  foo = db.IntegerProperty(default=0)

  def add_one(self):
    python_scoping_is_annoying = [None]
    def txn():
      new = python_scoping_is_annoying[0] = db.get(self.key())
      new.foo += 1
      new.put()
    db.run_in_transaction(txn)
    
    new = python_scoping_is_annoying[0]
    # Copy all new values over to this instance.
    for k in new.properties().keys() + new.dynamic_properties():
      setattr(self, k, getattr(new, k))



a = MyModel()
a.put()
print a.key(), a.foo
a.add_one()
print a.key(), a.foo
a.add_one()
print a.key(), a.foo



Output:

agVzaGVsbHIPCxIHTXlNb2RlbBjKqwUM 0
agVzaGVsbHIPCxIHTXlNb2RlbBjKqwUM 1

Thanks for the neat property sync code - it should definitely be useful to make the general approach more robust. It's still a long way from pretty though :-)

A shorter but less generic way to do this is just to add a one-line property sync after the put() call:

def tx():
      # Mess with some other related objects in data store.
      
      # Must fetch a separate copy of self to avoid side effects.
      person = db.get(self.key())
      person.count += 1
      person.put()
      self.count = person.count

Pete - whether that works or not is dependent on the way the transactionality is implemented by Google. If it stacks up the datastore operations then attempts to commit after the whole of tx() has run, but then fails, you'll already have modified self, and that modification will live on even though the datastore wasn't modified. This is precisely why tx() isn't supposed to have side effects.

Now I'm not sure quite how transactionality has been implemented by Google. If in fact it fails on the execution of put() if it's going to fail at all, then your approach is quite reasonable.

<p>I recently bought a proper &#39;not tied for you in the factory&#39; bow tie. Just a strip of wavy fabric to be assembled about my own neck! I figured I&#39;d look (even more) dashing with the genuine article, tied just imperfectly enough to make it clear that it&#39;s the real deal. The instructions on the back of the box were frankly useless so I turned to Google and after a few pictorial, textual and video tutorials I got the hang of it:</p><div><div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105370d5ffc970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BowTieTied" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105370d5ffc970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105370d5ffc970b-250wi" style="width: 250px; " /></a>&#0160;<br /></div><br /><div>It&#39;s not easy, and definitely requires a decent understanding of what you&#39;re <span style="font-style: italic;">supposed</span> to do, then some practise until you can actually do it, followed by more practice to fettle it into looking half decent. It&#39;s worth being familiar enough with the procedure to be able to replicate it as necessary, since you may find some joker pulling yours undone at the ball! But my friends would never do that. And I had a backup pre-tied one in my pocket just in case.</div><br /><div>My Marks and Sparks version came with an adjustable clasp in the middle, which is very useful to fit it to the neck properly and allows your hard fought bow creation to be saved for next time.</div><br /><div>So, where are my instructions on how to do it?

<p>I do quite a lot of futzing around developing web apps, and as a result I&#39;m often needing to choose colours to use in them, and I want those colours in HTML hex form - e.g. #ff0000 (<span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: &#39;Trebuchet MS&#39;; ">bright red</span>). The standard Mac OS X colour picker is a pretty reasonable colour picker, with all the features I want: colour wheel, RGB sliders, HSB sliders etc. but it lacks the most crucial feature - easy output of HTML hex codes! This is clearly a criminal omission, and it meant I&#39;d frequently have to convert from RGB 0-255 numbers down to hex, which is tedious in the extreme.</p><br /><div>Hence I was muchly pleased when I found <a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/" target="_blank">Hex Colour Picker</a>, which adds exactly this missing feature to the standard Mac colour picker panel. Perfect. Now I just open TextEdit, hit cmd-shift-c to bring up the colour panel and I have everything I need for web colour picking.</div>

<p>I&#39;ve been banging away at my Google App Engine application. It&#39;ll be a little while yet, but in the meantime, a particular observation about Python.&#0160;I keep getting tripped up when I refer to a member function without the parenthesis. For instance:</p><br /><div>&gt;&gt;&gt; list = [1,2,3,4,5]</div><div>&gt;&gt;&gt; print list.count</div><div>&lt;built-in method count of list object at 0x238fa8&gt;<br /></div><br /><div>This doesn&#39;t print &#39;5&#39;&#0160;because list.count is a reference to the count method itself, which (like everything else in Python) is an object, so gets printed. You need to use list.count() with those important parentheses in order to actually get the answer 5 that you wanted. I keep getting tripped up by this and taking a while to debug the problem every time. Some things like __class__ don&#39;t need parentheses, which I think is part of the confusion. Furthermore, when you use dir() to look up the public features of a class, it doesn&#39;t do anything to show you which ones are functions:</div><br /><div>&gt;&gt;&gt; dir([])</div><div><div>[&#39;__add__&#39;, &#39;__class__&#39;, &#39;__contains__&#39;, &#39;__delattr__&#39;, &#39;__delitem__&#39;, &#39;__delslice__&#39;, &#39;__doc__&#39;, &#39;__eq__&#39;, &#39;__ge__&#39;, &#39;__getattribute__&#39;, &#39;__getitem__&#39;, &#39;__getslice__&#39;, &#39;__gt__&#39;, &#39;__hash__&#39;, &#39;__iadd__&#39;, &#39;__imul__&#39;, &#39;__init__&#39;, &#39;__iter__&#39;, &#39;__le__&#39;, &#39;__len__&#39;, &#39;__lt__&#39;, &#39;__mul__&#39;, &#39;__ne__&#39;, &#39;__new__&#39;, &#39;__reduce__&#39;, &#39;__reduce_ex__&#39;, &#39;__repr__&#39;, &#39;__reversed__&#39;, &#39;__rmul__&#39;, &#39;__setattr__&#39;, &#39;__setitem__&#39;, &#39;__setslice__&#39;, &#39;__str__&#39;, &#39;append&#39;, &#39;count&#39;, &#39;extend&#39;, &#39;index&#39;, &#39;insert&#39;, &#39;pop&#39;, &#39;remove&#39;, &#39;reverse&#39;, &#39;sort&#39;]</div><br /><div>I rather suspect I&#39;ve missed a subtle but important bit of Python understanding, having only scratched the surface so far.

Cable cars are a part of history. I never knew these originated in the United States. I always thought they're from Europe. Anyway, I've never ridden one, and I'm hoping to someday.

Another &#39;what I had for dinner&#39; post. Sorry.</p><div><br /><div>Because there&#39;s a recession on, I went for cheap and cheerful: corned beef hash, as described in How to Boil an Egg - the most straightforward no-nonsense cookery book ever and a staple of any kitchen, surely! It really is simple: par-boil diced potato, then throw in a pan with chopped onion and diced corned beef. Fry for fifteen or so minutes with a beaten egg, ketchup, tabasco, worcestershire sauce, seasoning etc. until ready to eat. In my case, serve with baked beans, but I find that if you&#39;re just eating it on its own (like I did with the leftovers next day for lunch) it needs a good splurge of ketchup when served, to lubricate and tastify.</div><br /><div>I found that the corned beef disintegrates from the carefully chopped cubes almost instantaneously. Even my most careful and delicate pushing it around the frying pan resulted in complete disintegration within mere seconds. I&#39;m sure I remember corned beef hash from my childhood having nicely seared cubes of meat, so I don&#39;t know what I did wrong. I can only imagine that I&#39;m remembering wrongly, or I need to buy better ingredients. So I blame Sainsburys in this case.</div><br /><div><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536dcc0e2970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="CornedBeefHash" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536dcc0e2970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536dcc0e2970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>

BODY:
<p>I&#39;ve spent a bit more time learning Python, because I&#39;ve been dabbling with Google App Engine (which I&#39;m going off rapidly) but mainly because it&#39;s an interesting language. What&#39;s particularly intriguing to me is its similarity to Ruby, and hence where it differs in syntax or approach makes for a notable point of comparison. Of course it&#39;s probably more correct to say that Ruby is similar to Python than the other way around. From my still very small exposure to Python...</p><br /><div>Nice things about Python:</div><div><ul>
<li>Less confusion with the way classes work. Or maybe I just haven&#39;t stumbled into Python&#39;s equivalent of meta-classes and class vs instance variables.</li>
<li>@classmethod is a much neater way of stating what&#39;s a class method rather than an instance method, compared to all that self gubbins, or the dreaded &lt;&lt;.</li>
<li>Optional named arguments for functions, allowing more flexibility for optional arguments and greater clarity when calling. [As an aside I like Objective-C&#39;s way of building argument labels into the method signature, but not it&#39;s square brackety syntax: [obj message:foo]. I&#39;d much rather do obj.message(foo) and in fact with properties in Objective-C 2.0 we see more of this style.]</li>
<li>I think I probably prefer explicit return statements rather than the Ruby way of returning the last evaluated thing in any expression.</li>
<li>List comprehensions. To start with it just seems like a syntactic difference - Python: [x*2 for x in my_list] &#0160;Ruby: my_list.map {|x| x*2}. But Python&#39;s party trick is excluding elements as it goes: [x*2 for x in my_list if x != 3].</li>
</ul>
Nasty things about Python:</div><div><ul>
<li>Seriously - indentation to demarcate blocks? Apparently I&#39;ll get used to it.</li>
<li>Double underscores. __init__ is a complete pain to type. Why not just a single underscore at the start or something?</li>
<li>Fiddly module system. Why the need for an __init__.py file in a directory, just to make it a module? Why the need to explicitly define an __all__ method just to be able to import everything in a module? I want to be able to create a &quot;model/&quot; directory, put all the .py files for my DB classes in there, then import the whole lot from my other classes with ease. When I add a new model class, I shouldn&#39;t have to go and modify the __init__.py file. It seems to be a real pain to split code up into multiple files sensibly in Python. If I&#39;ve missed a trick here - please somebody show me the light!</li>
<li>The string interpolation is OK I suppose, giving the full power of C style formatting, but most of the time you&#39;re just doing simple interpolation and Ruby&#39;s syntax is far more pleasant and readable. Python: &quot;Hello %s, from %s.&quot; % (person, greeter) &#0160;Ruby: &quot;Hello {person}, from {greeter}.&quot; &#0160;Ruby also has a full on formatting system for the few times when you need it.</li>
</ul>
<span>&#0160;</span>&#0160;<br /></div>

 <br /></div><br /><div>I&#39;m getting used to some of the standard&#0160;manoeuvres in Indian curries: marinating meat in lime juice and salt; frying spices (but not burning them); finely chopped onion; garam masala and fresh herbs going in only at the end etc. This time I also did cumin-scented aubergine &amp; potato curry, at the same time! It was quite a logistical challenge, flipping between two recipes in the same book, both of which were complex and unfamiliar whilst trying not to mix up the two of them.

 <br /></div><br /><div>It was quite hot though - with three large fresh green chillies chopped and incorporate to both dishes. Not to mention the hot chilli powder and other spices. The missus found it all a bit too much actually, but I was in curry heaven.

<p>I was stumbling along in the gloom of another grey day at <a href="http://www.watercress-net.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="Watercress Wildlife Association">the WWA</a>. And at 3:30pm it was starting to get dark. Very poor conditions for wildlife photography! Then I noticed a small blue bird on a branch and bingo, there was one of the kingfishers in a spot I&#39;d never seen it before, and handy for me to rest my camera on the rail of a bridge only about 8m away. Here are the best couple of shots I got (the first was actually entirely handheld).</p><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536c5c1dc970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="KingfisherFish 5456" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536c5c1dc970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536c5c1dc970c-500wi" style="width: 500px; " /></a>

 <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">These are the best shots I&#39;ve ever managed to get of kingfishers so I&#39;m very pleased. They&#39;re a long way from decent by any professional standards (the things I see on TV or in magazines make me sick with envy and incredulity) but the opportunity was fleeting and the light dim, with my kit and technique straining at their very limits: 400mm, ISO 3200, f5.6, 1/100s. To top it all, the elusive water rail then walked along beneath it, though I didn&#39;t manage to get a shot of that, and still never have.</div>

BODY:
<p>Having ploughed through much of the documentation, done the tutorial and started writing my own little web app, I have some half-formed thoughts about <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">Google App Engine</a> to throw out to the world.</p><div><ul>
<li>As far as I can tell, any sort of data aggregation functionality (counting, averaging etc.) just won&#39;t be possible as the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/datastore/" target="_blank">Datastore APIs</a>&#0160;don&#39;t allow for it. I&#39;ve tried to think of ways to fake it but even my most elaborate machinations come up against the buffers. The only way to manage it at all is to do counting and averaging piecemeal, manually keeping the aggregate values you need up to date with each individual entity modification. Unfortunately, that means that you can&#39;t introduce new functionality requiring new aggregate values after you&#39;ve already got a million users, because you&#39;ve missed the chance to record those aggregates along the way.</li>
<li>Python&#39;s OK, but I don&#39;t like using indentation as the sole way to define blocks. But I&#39;m sure I can get used to that.</li>
<li>I really don&#39;t like having to put an empty __init__.py file in any subdirectories of my python code. If I don&#39;t do that it seems I can&#39;t <span style="font-family: Courier;">import foo.bar.Thingy</span>. Breaking up code into multiple files in a sensible directory structure is surely a fairly common thing to do, so I&#39;m amazed that Python makes it strangely difficult. I hope I&#39;ve simply missed something and it&#39;s actually easier than that.</li>
<li>In fact all those double underscores look horrid and are a pain to type. Surely a single underscore would have been quite&#0160;adequate?</li>
<li>The overall experience for learning GAE is very sorted. Smooth and well integrated - all you need to supply is your own decent text editor. I&#39;m trying out TextMate, the darling of Mac OS X code editors, but I&#39;m worried to see that it doesn&#39;t seem to have been updated for over a year.&#0160;</li>

I&#39;ve run through the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/gettingstarted/" target="_blank">getting started tutorial</a>, which is a delight I have to say, especially because it&#39;s so darned simple to get going on Mac OS X. Python is already installed and there&#39;s a neat app to download from Google which installs the app engine SDK bits and puts a nice GUI front end on it for you to fire up the local test environment and various other handy things, as well as installing the command line tools if you prefer them. Start up TextMate or any other editor of your choice and you&#39;re away!</div><br /><div>You&#39;ll have to take my word for it though, because I&#39;m tired and won&#39;t get onto writing my own app tonight.</div><br /><div>Footnote: Python seems OK, but so far I prefer Ruby, though they seem to share a lot in common.</div>

<p>It only seems like days ago that I put it up, but now the fake Xmas tree must come down again.

They&#39;re just as rough on the inside so it&#39;s touch and go whether it&#39;s the potato&#39;s skin or your own that sloughs off. Still, they made a fine job of the Xmas tree, whilst exfoliating my hands beautifully.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536b4e6b1970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="XmasTreePotatoGloves" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536b4e6b1970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536b4e6b1970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>

<p>Here's my second curry adventure from the Curry Bible my wife bought me for Xmas. <a href="/atc/2008/12/butter-chicken-from-ms-curry-bible.html" target="_blank">My first attempt was Butter Chicken </a>and was thoroughly awesome. This one was just as good I'd say, and it should be given all the ingredients that went into it: 8 different herbs and spices!</p><div><br><div><div style="text-align: center;"><a style="display: inline;" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536a7c3c0970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img  class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536a7c3c0970b " style="width: 330px; " alt="LambFenugreek1" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536a7c3c0970b-350wi"></a>  <a style="display: inline;" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536b04ee8970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img  class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536b04ee8970c " style="width: 330px; " alt="LambFenugreek2" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536b04ee8970c-350wi"></a> <br></div><br><div>The hardest thing to find was dried fenugreek leaves. The supermarket didn't have any so we walked to Hatfield Road, where St Albans' Asian community has a strong presence. The first shop we tried didn't have any but the proprietor was thoroughly helpful in pointing us to his competitor down the road who "has everything". He wasn't wrong - Madina Store is an Aladdin's Cave of wonderful foodstuffs, stacked floor to ceiling. It took us a while and some assistance before finding what we wanted, though it was in a packet akin to a family size box of Cornflakes. I only needed a tablespoon! Luckily my wife spotted a much smaller box (more Kellogg's Variety pack size) on the way out so we got that. We could also have got fresh Fenugreek leaves and anything else that has ever been used in Indian cooking as far as I could tell.</div><br><div style="text-align: center;"><a style="display: inline;" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536b04f1a970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img  class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536b04f1a970c " style="width: 330px; " alt="LambFenugreek4" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536b04f1a970c-350wi"></a>  <a style="display: inline;" href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536b04f33970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false"><img  class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536b04f33970c " style="width: 330px; " alt="LambFenugreek3" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536b04f33970c-350wi"></a>
 <br></div><br><div>The cooking was relatively straightforward with all the ingredients assembled, and almost a one-pot job. Marinate the lamb cubes in red wine vinegar and salt for a bit (which quickly turns it a funny colour), make up the sauce by adding various things to a saucepan as per the recipe and leave to simmer with the meat in it for 50 minutes or so. This is the only cooking the meat gets - no frying. One issue I did have was that the cinnamon stick (only a small piece) disintegrates quite readily and is then a pain to pick out in shards whilst eating it. The recipe made no mention of the stick after adding it, so it's a mystery what was supposed to happen to it.</div><br><div>The only downer on the washing up front is that you have to use a separate pan to fry the garam masala (only 1/4 of a teaspoon of it) at the very end, before adding it to the rest. I messed this bit up by burning the spices in oil that was too hot, and had to throw it away and try that bit again. No damage done.</div><br><div>The result was served with some curried veg from Waitrose - they seem to have a new range - to bulk it out, and garlic and coriander naan. It was another great meal from the good book, though it doesn't make a great deal and needed the bulking out.</div></div></div>

I&#39;d really struggle to pick out a weak point in fact, which is probably why it&#39;s won so many awards this past year (on Mac, PC and Wii). Best of all is the demo version contains the whole of the first chapter (out of five) and the whole game only cost me £13 to download.</div><br /><div><a href="http://worldofgoo.com/dl2.php?lk=demo" target="_blank">Download the demo</a> and have a go today!</div>

<p>My wife bought me the <a href="http://www.marksandspencer.com/gp/product/B001DTWY1K?mnSBrand=core" target="_blank" title="Curry Bible, Marks and Spencer">Curry Bible</a> for Xmas, from Marks and Spencer - not to be confused with various other similarly named books. It&#39;s a great recipe book as it keeps things relatively simple, and contains most of my curry house favourites. It explains things in a decent manner that certainly worked for me, judging by the results!</p><div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105369b38b8970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ButterChicken1" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105369b38b8970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105369b38b8970b-350wi" style="width: 350px; " /></a>&#0160; <a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536a34029970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ButterChicken2" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536a34029970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536a34029970c-350wi" style="width: 350px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><br /><div>I made Butter Chicken for my first attempt. This uses tandoori chicken (the nicest single foodstuff in the world) but I wasn&#39;t up for doing that entirely from scratch this time around. The supermarket didn&#39;t have any tandoori chicken ready to go though, so I bought chicken thighs (free range) and a jar of tandoori paste. Add lemon juice, salt, oil and yoghurt, mix it all up (or get wife to, as in the picture) marinate overnight in the fridge then blast in the oven to get that slightly charred surface. Then I took the chicken off the bone and used it in big chunks in the Butter Chicken recipe. I&#39;ll be doing tandoori chicken again, since it was so easy and so delicious even on its own.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105369b398c970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ButterChicken3" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105369b398c970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105369b398c970b-350wi" style="width: 350px; " /></a>&#0160; <a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536a340b3970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ButterChicken4" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536a340b3970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536a340b3970c-350wi" style="width: 350px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><br /><div>I shan&#39;t bore you with the details of the recipe (or invite a copyright problem) but it wasn&#39;t crazy difficult and the results were to die for. The quality of the chicken in particular really made it stand out from usual curry house fare. I know the final picture of it on the plate just looks like an orange splat, but trust me it was great, and I couldn&#39;t be doing with garnishing with nuts and coriander sprigs.</div><br /></div>

<p>Last Tuesday I went to <a href="http://www.thewhitelionph.co.uk/" target="_blank">The White Lion</a> pub (a preferred local of mine, but blimey that&#39;s a low-fi website if ever I saw one) to see the <a href="http://www.deadvictorians.co.uk/" target="_blank">Dead Victorians</a>. These fine chaps are quite magnificent - music hall entertainment from a bygone era crammed with interesting instruments and innuendo.</p><div>This is the second time I&#39;ve seen them, in the same venue as it happens, but both times they have been a threesome, without the elusive Pedro. I don&#39;t know why, but the good Dr. Blake doesn&#39;t seem to be in any of the publicity photos and gets nary a mention on the CD (on sale that evening for the first time) whilst appearing to be a thoroughly integral part of the band on drums, many vocals, spoons, washboard etc.</div><br /><div>I&#39;ll quite happily admit that it was seeing the Dead Victorians for the first time that tipped me over the edge and caused me to buy an&#0160;accordion. It was a pleasure to see them again, though the photos I took are shamefully poor, taken as they were from the back of a crowded but dark pub with a small compact camera. The blur sitting in front of Maestro Paul on the accordion is the good doctor playing the typewriter to accompany a&#0160;vigourous trombone rendition of the William Tell Overture.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105368a169e970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="DeadVictorians" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105368a169e970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105368a169e970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>

<p>In my last post I complained about just a few of the many terrible failings of First Capital Connect Thameslink. One of my bugbears was the 5-across nature of the trains - a thoroughly uncivilised way to pack people into a tin can. What do you know, the very next day the 0842 from St Albans was comprised of old Southern rolling stock (still, probably newer than all the other TL stuff) with 4 seats across, armrests, tables and even a funky coffee bar type area with rounded armchairs and stand-up tables. It was just a teaser though, with normal cramped service resumed today.</p><div><br /><div>Here&#39;s what heaven looks like, courtesy of poor quality phone camera.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105368688f6970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="FCC4Across" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105368688f6970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105368688f6970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>

<p>It&#39;s always a worrying time when the train timetables change and I find out whether my commute is going to get better or worse. First Capital Connect have been promising a lot since they bought the franchise into London (I commute from St Albans to Kentish Town) but delivering little from my point of view. Today new timetables came into effect and I longed to see those &quot;more trains&quot;, &quot;longer trains&quot;, &quot;disco carriage in every train&quot; promises fulfilled. Actually I made up one of those. Actually I&#39;d might as well have made up all of them.</p><br /><div>My main two morning trains (I don&#39;t always get the same one) are much the same, except one is now four cars instead of eight. The reason I went for these trains in the first place was that they were eight car so I&#39;d get to London without being crushed. Oh well.</div><br /><div>My evening trains appear unchanged. Between 1802 and 1914 there are <span style="font-style: italic;">still</span> no eight car trains. So I either have to leave work before six or after seven unless I want to fight for standing space.</div><br /><div>I find it insulting that they joke about twelve car trains whilst reducing existing eight car services to four. I will find it doubly insulting in the new year when the fares leap up by inflation busting amounts same as they have each and every year before (usually 6-9%). I can only dream of the day when the whole fleet is replaced by trains with four seats across rather than five, bringing them blinking into the light of civilised society enjoyed by most of the rest of the country.</div>

<p>When the wife&#39;s away and you have to make dinner from the limited remains in the fridge, you end up with the extraordinary feast that is the omelette baguette. Frankly I&#39;m pretty proud of this creation, because it was absolutely delicious and over the top.

Incidentally, I always keep a big dried sausage in the fridge as it&#39;s perfect for slicing into lots of things: omelettes, pasta, laid on top of grilled fish, pizza or just to scoff as a Dutch style snack.</div><br /><div>The baguette was a part-baked one from Waitrose in this case. These are amazing as they have a shelf life of about a month (I don&#39;t want to know what they put in them to achieve this - I like to think it&#39;s just the airtight sterile packaging) and can be whacked in the oven for 10 minutes for fresh hot bread. Having let it cool a little I sliced it open and put my gooey omelette inside, cut into three pieces so it fit the long, narrow sandwich. I then added slices of tomato and a bit of pepper. Beautiful, but admittedly a bit of a coronary on a plate.</div></div></div>

<div>This is an amazing beer. It tastes like a really flavourful Chardonnay - full of oak and vanilla, with a very buttery finish. Given it&#39;s aged in American oak barrels, that&#39;s not surprising, but honestly most people would be absolutely gobsmacked when trying this beer, it&#39;s just so different to anything they will have tasted before.</div><br /><div>It&#39;s fairly strong, like most of Innis &amp; Gunn&#39;s range, but like all of their range, it&#39;s totally to die for.

I picked this book up on a whim because I liked the sound of the basic premise. Having now read it I know for sure that it&#39;s one of the most original ideas for a novel that I&#39;ve come across in a long time, and neatly executed as well.</p><br /><div>The classic Greek gods, Zeus, Apollo, Aphrodite, Eros, Artemis etc. are living in a rather dirty house in London, just about keeping up with their godly duties, though nobody believes in them anymore. A couple of mortals get mixed up in their petty bickering and things spiral from there. The way these classic gods and their legends are mixed in to modern day London is brilliantly entertaining, and the plot picks up speed and keeps it going. More than many books I&#39;ve read recently I struggled to put it down.</div><br /><div>It&#39;s not quite perfect - in some indefinable way it just seemed a little simplistic at times - but definitely comes highly recommended.</div>

BODY:
<p>Apparently some people call Scotch pancakes drop scones instead. It&#39;s a strange world and takes all sorts, or so I&#39;m reliably informed.</p><div><br /><div>That aside, I decided to make some from scratch for breakfast a couple of weeks back, to go with the maple cured bacon and maple syrup we already had. We always used to just buy a packet of Scotch pancakes and stick them in the toaster, but we didn&#39;t have any in and that small problem wasn&#39;t going to stand in the way of my breakfast.</div><br /><div>The recipe&#39;s really ludicrously simple, though the wife seems to have hidden the Hugh Fearnley-Doodah book I used at the time. Luckily, I found <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2006/oct/21/recipes.foodanddrink1" target="_blank">his recipe online here</a> and I think it&#39;s about the same as the one I used from the book. What confuses me though is the one from the book made about 30 scones so I halved the quantities, whereas this online version says it makes 12, but looks like the version that I read before halving, so use your own judgement :-) One thing I found is that weighing out really small quantities accurately is quite tricky with analog scales, but it didn&#39;t seem to cause a problem.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536356668970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ScotchPancakesBatter" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010536356668970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010536356668970c-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>&#0160; <a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401053635669a970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ScotchPancakesFrying" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401053635669a970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401053635669a970c-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><br /><div>It&#39;s really very quick and easy to make the batter, the critical thing being the liquidity. I must have got it right, because they spread out nicely to just the right thickness on the hot frying pan and looked like the real deal. I found with a non-stick pan they were really trouble free when flipping, not requiring careful extra oiling as Hugh suggested. I was able to do four at a time, and stacked them up when done, but I failed to keep them warm enough whilst then frying the bacon (I wanted to use that same pan) so the butter didn&#39;t melt on them as well as I&#39;d have liked. Next time I&#39;ll probably keep them under foil and maybe give them a quick zap in the microwave just the steam them up a bit before bringing to the table.</div><br /><div>Finally - and frankly this was a touch of genius-like inspiration - I served with lime wedges. The lime juice cuts through the sweet maple syrup to take it to another level of breakfast heaven! Look at that picture and imagine the pancakes buttered and real Canadian maple syrup drizzled all over..</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105363566eb970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="ScotchPancakesPlated" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105363566eb970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105363566eb970c-500wi" style="width: 500px; " /></a>

BODY:
<p>I&#39;ve almost always been disappointed with bought flapjacks, or flapjacks made by other people - because I have a very particular vision in my mind of how the perfect flapjack should be, which is apparently different to everyone else&#39;s. To me, perfection is golden, sweet, initially slightly brittle yet yielding to become jaw-achingly chewy. The overriding flavour should be oats and golden syrup. Putting flour in a flapjack is anathema of course - this is a chewy, oaty treat, not a soft cake!</p><div>So I set out to create the perfect flapjack by starting with a basic recipe and modifying till I found nirvana in a baking tin. My first effort was just a straightforward attempt to act as a benchmark, using the following straightforward approach, modified from several I found across the internet:</div><br />

<ul>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">125g Whole rolled jumbo oats</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">125g Oatmeal (because all whole oats is apparently a bit much)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">150g butter</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">75g Golden syrup (the single most important ingredient - Tate &amp; Lyle of course)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">75g caster sugar (I used golden caster sugar)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">

Melt the butter, syrup and sugar together in a pan, add everything else, stir together than put into a 20*20cm tin lined with baking parchment. Put in oven at 175c for 20mins or so, but if you&#39;re oven&#39;s anything like mine you really need to keep an eye on it!</span></p><div><span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span></div><div>Here are the before and after going in the oven shots:</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401053622cb4c970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="FlapjackRaw" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401053622cb4c970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401053622cb4c970b-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>
 <a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401053622cb19970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="FlapjackCooked" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401053622cb19970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401053622cb19970b-300wi" style="width: 300px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Looked pretty good and tasted OK, with decent chewy texture, but not the flavour I was after - just not enough golden syrupyness coming through.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">So I tried again, this time using much more syrup and much less butter (they were a bit greasy first time). I also threw in a handful of sultanas to add moist chewiness and flavour. After only 15 minutes it was &#39;done&#39; and came out looking like this:</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105362b1f21970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="FlapjackBurnt" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105362b1f21970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105362b1f21970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">It took some serious effort to cut it into those few pieces, but I gave up after that. Those black blobs are the sultanas, embedded within the concrete that was the &#39;improved&#39; flapjack. Honestly you could have made houses with this stuff. I think I know what the butter&#39;s for now! The experiment will continue...</div>

BODY:
<p>Just 48 hours ago I had a bilateral inguinal hernia repair, by way of open surgery (rather than laparoscopic &#39;keyhole&#39; surgery). Which is to say I was sliced open twice, either side of my lower abdomen, just above the groin. Plastic meshes were inserted to patch up the problem and stop it happening again. This is very routine surgery, but it was still rather traumatic and the recovery has not been a breeze. Still, I made it home within 24 hours and am getting slowly better now, though I&#39;m still very inflexible and pained. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d have done without my wife to help me!</p><br /><div>I expect to be off work for another week, and maybe getting back to playing football within a couple of months. We&#39;ll see.</div><br /><div>If anyone has any specific questions about the routine, I&#39;d be happy to answer them as I found it really useful to have lots of first-hand information before I went into it.</div>

<p>No, the other Budweiser! The Czech one that makes good beers!</p><div>This dark variant of the much acclaimed Budvar apparently won Best Beer in the World or somesuch at a worldwide competion in 2007. I can just about believe it too, as it&#39;s a great example of decent lager, that puts the usual piss-water to shame. It&#39;s not even especially strong (sub 5%) but manages to push a great deal of flavour through to you, whilst not overdoing it. I&#39;ve even seen it served on draught in pubs, often in a fancy heavy tankard. I thoroughly recommend it.</div><br /><div><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105360c0813970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="BudvarDark" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105360c0813970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105360c0813970c-500wi" style="width: 500px; " /></a>

The doors open whilst the lift is still moving and your foot hits the carpet outside at the exact same moment that the lift stops. Your face creases into a grimace as you think back to Blighty and wonder why Messrs Otis and Schindler send us the factory seconds.</div><br /><div>But seriously, why are lifts in the UK so utterly terrible?</div><br />

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">I&#39;m a big fan of Tim Moore&#39;s books, and the &quot;do some wacky stuff then write about it in an amusing way&quot; genre as a whole. That said, his previous effort Nul Points, about the history and characters of the Eurovision Song Contest left me cold - in fact I never even finished it. So I was a little nervous about this very latest tome, which has a similar historical bent, rather than a completely asinine caper at its core&#0160; (like pilgramiging through Spain with a donkey - quite an ass-inine caper). I needn&#39;t have worried.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>


<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">The world of living history (historical re-enactment is perhaps a more meaningful term to most) turns out to be a rich seam ripe for comedy mining. Certainly more so than going to visit a Norwegian who once sang on tele. Fighting as part of a Roman garrison against the Gauls, living the life of a Tudor chamberlain and a succession of other historical roles present a cavalcade of hilarity, mostly sourced from the usually very committed people involved and his own struggles to fit in and be authentic. There are some truly laugh out loud moments and the book is fairly un-put-downable.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">Will you learn a great deal about history by reading this book? Probably not, but you&#39;ll learn a lot about historical re-enactment. I was really surprised by some of it, especially the authenticity of the violence! Tim was too, clearly.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">Final verdict: A cracking example of the genre and highly recommended. I hope the next one is as good.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; margin-bottom:25px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">Here are my favourite other books of his:</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p>

I look forward to reading this one, but you've missed my favourite TIm Moore book off your list: Do Not Pass Go. A fantastic mix of travel and history writing as he travels around London visiting all the places on the Monopoly board. Well worth reading!

BODY:
<p>This is a much maligned beer, with many beer snobs writing it off almost immediately for being weak (3.6%), in a can and from such a mainstream brewery. That said, this same beer (on draft) was champion beer of Britain (Bitter category) and silver overall in 2004. Some people were so horrified by this that they threw their CAMRA cards out of their prams at the time. Personally I rather like it!</p><div><br /><div>It&#39;s the four pack of cans that I reach for most often from the supermarket shelf, precisely because it&#39;s weak (I&#39;m a Radio 2 listening 30 year old now) and fairly cheap, whilst not being too bland or too over the top. You don&#39;t always want an intensely flavoured, knock your head off brew. It has a decent, malty flavour with a drinkable level of bitterness that&#39;s great when you&#39;re after a mild but satisfying beverage, and it doesn&#39;t too badly for having come in a can.</div><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535cc3684970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="GreeneKingIPA" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010535cc3684970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535cc3684970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>

 Last time we visited, we ate in the fancy kitchen restaurant and I had the most wonderful duck ever, along with a cracking glass of red.

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">Right from the start I'll point out that God Lager is Swedish for good lager, though the rear label makes plenty of hints that this is in fact a divine beverage. I bought it from Waitrose purely because it looked a little unorthodox on the shelf and seemed to promise something that it could surely never live up to.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">And frankly it didn't. This is a fairly straightforward lager in pretty much every sense, though it has a very fine bubble (in fact it almost seemed flat) that gives it a somewhat classy feel, but only just. Maybe it only achieves perfection in being the perfect example of average, unassuming lager? Even if it is, I need something with a bit more flavour to get excited about. Still - credit to the Nils Oscar Company's marketing department for a good gimmick.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535bb7a04970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, '_blank', 'width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0' ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img  alt="GodLager" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010535bb7a04970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535bb7a04970c-500wi" style="width: 500px; margin-top:15px;"></a>

have you tried it again? I think it's a grower. I was the same, thought it was a perfect example of what an average beer should be (even though you'd be hard pressed to find one in your local) but after a few more bottles I think Its actually a very fine brew...

Haven't tried it again yet and I wasn't planning to - but you may have swayed me, especially if I see it on special offer.

BODY:
<p>We went to Whipsnade Zoo at the weekend, because it&#39;s fairly close by (surprisingly so - only took 25 mins from St Albans) and we&#39;ve been meaning to for a while. A two-for-one voucher from a cereal box was the clincher, saving us £17 on the entry price. We did exactly the same for London Zoo a couple of months back. With Whipsnade being run by ZSL it&#39;s a sort of outpost of London Zoo and so we couldn&#39;t help but compare and contrast the two.</p><br /><div>The first thing we noticed is that it&#39;s a lot colder, windier and greyer. But that could just have been autumn arriving with full force. It&#39;s certainly a lot more open, with some really huge paddocks of green grass, trees, hummocks etc. with animals dotted about within them, almost Safari park like. That does mean there&#39;s less variety overall and it&#39;s a bit of a walk to get around, but it&#39;s pleasant and you feel the animals are probably happier with the extra space. At least some of them. One medium sized oak was home to this delightful red panda. It was easily the cutest thing we saw all day, beating the otters into second place.</div><br /><div><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535a11f73970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="RedPanda" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010535a11f73970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535a11f73970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><br /><div>It struck me that all it had to do to escape was walk to the end of a branch and jump past the fence. Presumably it isn&#39;t so inclined. I always seem to end up figuring out escape plans for the animals, and it often looks like it wouldn&#39;t be so hard. If the chimpanzees simply got together and dragged a branch into the right place they could be up and over the fence, tall as it is, in a jiffy.</div><br /><div>We caught a sealion show, which was quite impressive. Three out of the four of them provided accomplished routines, whilst the fourth (Dominic, the youngest) played the fool, which added to the charm.</div><br /><div><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535a123c9970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SealionsGroup" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010535a123c9970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535a123c9970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><br /><div>I took my big Nikon 80-400mm VR lens and was glad I did as it really helped to get in close, especially given the large enclosures often meant the animals were far away. It&#39;s not that great for action, being a bit slow, but I got a half-reasonable jumping sealion.</div><br /><div><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535a125e9970c-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="SealionJump" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e01588834010535a125e9970c " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e01588834010535a125e9970c-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>
 <br /></div><br /><div>I rate the zoo quite highly and would recommend allocating a whole day to visit, though it&#39;s a shame it doesn&#39;t have a bit more dense indoor stuff (insects, reptiles, fish etc.) to counter-balance the wide-open spaces. It has just the one very cramped Discovery Centre which is decent, if a bit MDF heavy, but the zoo could do with more of the same, spread about the place and implemented in a slicker fashion. There&#39;s a bit of a crumbling feel in a few places and the signage to tell you what you&#39;re looking at is woeful for most of the outdoor stuff.</div><br /><div>I took a great many pictures, as usual, but I&#39;ll finish with an obligatory tiger - grrrrr!</div><br /><div><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105359a054a970b-popup" onclick="window.open( this.href, &#39;_blank&#39;, &#39;width=640,height=480,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0&#39; ); return false" style="display: inline;"><img alt="TigerSleepy (1)" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e015888340105359a054a970b " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e015888340105359a054a970b-400wi" style="width: 400px; " /></a>

Jeremy Clarkson pulled the same trick on me a couple of years back. Thing is, they don't go out of their way to make it clear just what you're buying, choosing the words on the cover oh so cleverly, to be accurate but not quite clue you in if you didn't already know. I find this ironic since a lot of the book consists of Hugh pouring forth with righteous indignation about all the commercial dishonesty out there in the food business.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">The first chapter is actually a bit wearing as Hugh lays it on extremely thick, making and re-making the same simple points over and over again about McDonalds and their ilk. It got a bit tiresome and I very nearly gave up entirely. However I persevered and it got better from there on, though the whole volume is still preachy and sometimes patronising. That said, yesterday I bought Waitrose' organic cheddar even though it was 10p per kilo more expensive that the normal stuff,  which is no doubt made out of cigarette butts and arsenic, with old AA membership cards ground up and added for colour. Actually I bet it's exactly the same bar the packaging. So Hugh's taught me two things there: to search out decent ingredients with good provenance; and to maintain an unhealthy level of cynicism and suspicion at all times.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">Overall it's a good book that I'd recommend for anyone that likes Hugh to start with and just likes good food writing. The best bits of the book are the gastronomic exotica that the cover promises and Hugh's excellent style, full of wit and anecdote and very giving of himself. He does go on about brains a lot though.</p>

<p>The missus had the brilliant idea of going to see England play at Wembley, so we did just that yesterday! It&#39;s quite a slick operation, as you&#39;d hope, with the tube and the venue doing an impressive job of getting 90,000 fans to and from the game. In fact the Jubilee line tube we left on was only half-full as the old bridges at the station just can&#39;t deliver people to the platform fast enough. Still, it only took about 30 mins to get from our seat into a tube.</p><div>I was shocked and I suppose only mildly amazed that there was no beer for sale in the venue. I&#39;d assumed that you wouldn&#39;t be allowed it in the bowl itself, but that it would be available in the concourses. And yes, there were the signs, proudly proclaiming &quot;Pie and a pint&quot;, &quot;Cold Beer here&quot; etc. But when I asked I was laughed at. I did later spot a small sign saying that UEFA had decreed that this is the way it must be, but it&#39;s just harsh to advertise beer everywhere whilst not serving any. The tickets and FA website didn&#39;t make any mention of it either, that I could see. How very uncivilised.</div><p><br /><span style="color: #0000ff; "><img alt="Wembley" border="0" class="at-xid-6a00e5550e0158883401053579f748970b selected " src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5550e0158883401053579f748970b-800wi" style="cursor: pointer !important; border-top-style: none; border-right-style: none; border-bottom-style: none; border-left-style: none; border-width: initial; border-color: initial; float: right; padding-left:15px;" title="Wembley" /></span></p><div>That said, it was the least hostile atmosphere I&#39;ve ever known at a football game, and the lack of beer is probably to thank for that. At no point did I even fear for my life! How very civilised.</div><br /><div>The ticket made it VERY clear that cameras were strictly verboten, so with a heavy heart we didn&#39;t take any, which is shame because the new stadium is a fine photographic muse. That&#39;s why you have to do with a poor snap from my phone as we sat behind the goal. England scored all 5 into that goal in the second half, and the England Band (sponsored by Pukka Pies apparently) played about ten rows behind us. And in front of us sat a woman with a massive camera. In fact we appeared to be about the only people there without one. That&#39;s what you get for playing by the rules.</div>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px">A recently hectic calendar has meant no time to go to the supermarket, which isn&#39;t such a bad thing as it has shown us the back of our kitchen cupboards for the first time in a while. As we chomp through the ancient stocks a few surprises have come to light. One such was Astronaut Ice Cream, given to me as a Xmas present a year or two ago, but still good till December 2010 if you believe the foil sachet. And yes, this was in the cupboard, not the freezer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">It&#39;s real ice cream, but freeze dried, so all the water has been removed. I expected to find a powder to which I&#39;d add water for some surreally room temperature ice creamy experience, but no. Inside the feather light pack (contents: 19g) is a single slice of Neapolitan ice cream. It looks like ice cream, but it&#39;s completely dry and crisp, with the texture of a really fine, dense foam. And apparently it&#39;s &quot;ready to eat&quot; as is.</p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica"></p>

 </p><p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">So I snapped off a piece (actually the block was somewhat shattered to start with) trying not to get shards of ice cream in my eye and popped it in my mouth. It&#39;s crunchy to start with, but very quickly turns to dust which immediately combines with the saliva in your mouth to become something like ice cream. However the airy texture has been lost and there&#39;s only so much saliva in your mouth, so it&#39;s denser and perhaps pastier than the real thing. That said, it tastes the part - no doubt about it. I wonder if freezing the block to start with would add to the ice-creamy experience or just make it weirder.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; min-height: 14.0px"></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica">I can see how the weight saving and longevity of freeze-drying are handy for trips into space, but the astronaut will still need to consume the same total quantity of water so I would have thought that vacuum packed hydrated food would take up less space overall and just be outright nicer. In fact paraphrasing from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-dried_ice_cream" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia article on space ice cream">Wikipedia&#39;s article</a> although freeze-dried ice cream was developed on request, it wasn&#39;t that popular, and was only taken into space once on Apollo 7 in 1968.&quot;&#0160;It was a good present though and a conversation starter.</p>

<p>Ever so slightly cloudy but virbantly coloured beer - like egg yolk almost.</p>

<p>A somewhat bitter, thirst-quenching summer brew. With the terrible summer having run out of what steam if had, that's probably why it was a pound a bottle in Sainsburys. Hints of honey perhaps, though hard to tie down.</p>

<p>Very pleasant indeed - it's a shame I've only just discovered it as the summer weakly waves goodbye.</p>

Hello,

Do you still have that Parrot accordion? Does it play well?

I do still have it. Sometimes I even play it :-) I don't much to compare to in order to know if it plays 'well'.

<p>Read the <a href="/atc/2008/09/accordions-ever.html">first</a> and <a href="/atc/2008/09/accordions-firs.html">second</a> instalments if you haven't already.</p>

<p>With a renewed vigour I set out in search of a larger selection of accordions, courtesy of a dedicated shop stacked ceiling to floor with them: <a href="http://www.accordionsoflondon.com/index.php">Accordions of London</a> in Kilburn. The proprietor, John Leslie, is a fantastic player (he treated me to a bit of a show piece), teacher and all round accordion authority. At least that's the way it seemed and I have no reason to doubt it!</p>

<p>I learnt yet more interesting things (as I am prone to doing):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>His Chinese accordions are similarly priced and look near identical to the ones I saw the day before, though John says his are better as he's very particular with the factory about exactly how they are specced. They certainly seemed a bit nicer to play, but I'm so far from being the authority on such subtleties that I'd have to place an expensive long distance phone call in order to speak to that authority.</p></li>
<li><p>His Eastern European Luciano accordions are a bit more differentiated and I understand they come from the Weltmeister factory, but again, specced to John's exacting standards. The problem for me is that a half-decent size one of these starts at about £1000.</p></li>
<li><p>I had a go on one of the properly expensive machines (one of John's own) and it certainly felt nice and played beautifully. One thing I noted was that the more expensive the machine, the better it was at evenly putting out sound in both bass and treble at the same time. The ones I tried yesterday were terrible in that respect.</p></li>
<li><p>A proper non-budget model starts at about £1200 and that's second hand. One of the two rooms was filled with more serious models, ranging into the many thousands of pounds. And very nice (and heavy) I'm sure they were too!</p></li>
<li><p>John reckoned I should get a full size model (41 keys, 120 bass) because otherwise it wouldn't fit me properly. He advocates sitting down to play with the accordion well wedged between legs and chin. Smaller models can't be wedged in that manner.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So, all very exciting, but it was looking like a bleak prospect for me and my limited budget. It was either that or pay £1200 for a fairly good 120 bass model, but I just couldn't bring myself to do that.</p>

<p>John and his assistant scoured the somewhat dusty shelves and eventually found a Parrot accordion for about half that price, with the full complement of keys and buttons, 4 treble voices with 13 switches and 5 bass voices with 6 switches. And a decent pair of straps and a hard case. So, the right size and well specced! It's a new accordion but it's been sat on the shelf for a few years, by a Chinese manufacturer of not particularly special repute. It's clearly not as good as most of the others in the shop, but it's now mine!</p>

<p>I'd post a photo, but I'm not picking it up until later in the week after the metal strap bracket has been moved so as not to dig into my leg. All that remains now is to lug it home and learn how to play the darn thing.</p>

<p><a href="/atc/2008/09/accordions-ever.html">Read the first instalment</a> if you haven't already.</p>

<p>The thot plickens! I have now visited a genuine purveyor of accordions: <a href="http://www.hobgoblin.com/london/index.php">Hobgoblin Music in London</a> - on Rathbone Place just between Goodge Street and Tottenham Court Road. It's a cracking little shop, rammed full of instrumental exotica. I struggled to pull my gaze away from the extensive selection of tasty banjos, but a helpful assistant saddled me up with a weighty accordion and off I went.</p>

<p>I didn't go far though, managing only to randomly jab keys and buttons in a tuneless mêlée of fumbling fingers. I learnt some useful things:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The left hand is incapable of reaching even the limited 72 buttons on my test model, without resetting the hand position within the strap. That strap has to be quite tight to stop your hand sliding up to the top due to the effect of gravity on that end of the machine.</p></li>
<li><p>The tighter the hand strap, the less gravity is a problem but the less freedom you have to move, even though the only way you can move is upwards - due to that pesky gravity.</p></li>
<li><p>You can't see that huge field of identical buttons under the fingers of your left hand, so all you've got to go on is feel. One of the buttons has a concave top to differentiate it from the others, and presumably everything else is relative. Einstein himself would struggle to find that one dimpled button in the first place, let alone suss out the others. Figure out those buttons and you've figured out the accordion I reckon.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't squeeze hard enough on the bellows, you don't get any sound at all from the piano side. All the air rushes out of the bass reeds instead, given there are more of them open and they're bigger. It stands to reason, but the more notes you play at once (including chord buttons, or using multiple reed banks) the more air you need to keep it all going.</p></li>
<li><p>The bellows trap your t-shirt when compressed. Remember to free yourself when unstrapping.</p></li>
<li><p>Even for £900 you just get a smallish, plasticky accordion, albeit a Czech one. You'll pay about £350 for the Chinese equivalent, which seemed largely identical in most respects, but had almost no feedback from the buttons used to select treble reed banks.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I decided not to buy right there and then. I think I need to see a larger selection and maybe some second hand instruments to find what I'm after. Quality is important to me, but it's going to be difficult to find that elusive feel of solid craftsmanship for the cash I have to splash. I'll report back on the quest.</p>

BODY:
<p>I've been looking to buy a piano accordion. Why? I just love the sound, they're an intriguing and mysterious instrument to most people and I have a growing habit of buying interesting instruments then failing to learn to play them. Still, a lot of the fun is in the chase, and I'm maximising my enjoyment of this one!</p>

<p>To that end, I've been devouring information about piano accordions online, though I'm still yet to actually touch one! Hopefully I'll manage that later this week with a visit to a London music shop, but for now, here's my ultra-condensed guide to what I think I need to know about accordions in order to make an informed purchasing decision. We'll see if I was actually right.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Piano accordions can have different numbers of piano keys (right-hand) and bass buttons (left-hand). The 'full' set is 41 piano keys and 120 bass buttons.</p></li>
<li><p>The bass buttons (in a 120 bass at least) are laid out in 6 rows, with top two rows being single note counter-bass and bass, the the remaining four playing chords rooted on their associated bass note. So the left hand can play individual notes and chords. This is known as a Stradella bass system.</p></li>
<li><p>A free bass system just has lots of individual notes, so you must form chords manually with multiple presses at once. This is considered by some to be a more purist approach and allows greater musical flexibility, especially for the classical scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Some 'converter' accordions can switch between Stradella and free bass. I'd like one of those (I want the moon on a stick) but I get the impression they're not so common and probably not cheap.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of cheap, though you can get small accordions (e.g. with only as few as eight bass buttons) for less than £100, it looks like you need to spend £400 or more to get a 120 bass accordion from a cheap Chinese manufacturer. £1500 will buy a half-decent Italian model, but the options just get more expensive from there.</p></li>
<li><p>Accordions are heavy - think 8Kg or more. They come with shoulder straps as a rule.</p></li>
<li><p>There is more than one way to tune an accordion, giving quite different types of sound. Tuning is a job for an expert (requires tweaking metal reeds) and probably done every five years or more, so best buy one that's tuned well to start with!</p></li>
<li><p>It doesn't matter how hard you press the piano keys or buttons - volume is controlled by your pressure on the bellows. Apparently this can be hard for a pianist to get to grips with, being more akin to bowing a cello.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I repeat: this is just what I think is true - I stand to be corrected, and will post an update as the story unfolds.</p>

BODY:
<p>I spotted this beer at a pound a bottle in Sainsbury's so grabbed a couple as it sounded really different. It describes itself as being made with wheat and barley malts (rather than just barley as is normal), fermented with honey then conditioned for six months with spices - though it doesn't say which spices!</p>

<p><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/27/sharpsbeer.jpg"><img alt="Sharpsbeer" title="Sharpsbeer" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/images/2008/09/27/sharpsbeer.jpg" width="350" height="237" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>I thought it might be similar to a continental wheat beer - cloudy white with hints of spice - but it's definitely its own style of beer. It's a very rich amber and almost entirely clear. The flavour is quite deep, bitter and smoky with a slightly burnt malt flavour reminiscent of a stout. The spice just leaves a subtle, lingering flavour in the mouth.</p>

<p>At 6% ABV and with a real depth of colour and flavour it's not a 'light' beer in any sense. It's almost a winter warmer, but I hadn't twigged that until I'd poured it to accompany the grand prix qualifying mid-afternoon. Still, I quite like it and it was well priced, even for a 330ml bottle, so cheers!</p>

Almost every weekend this summer a trip to Kew Gardens has been on the cards, and finally we made it happen. We managed to pick a great day for it too - even wearing sunscreen for only about the second time this year. Having heard so much about the wonders of Kew we were really looking forward to it, but could it possibly live up to our expectations?</p>

<h2>Getting There</h2>

<p>Round the M25 and in on the M4 was easy enough but the signage ran out just when we got close and we spent twenty minutes trying to find the official parking. The pay and display machines in the long, slender car park mischievously require £5 in change, which means a long walk to the main ticket booth and back to the car, then back to the booth to actually enter the gardens if you're unlucky. Nice.</p>

<h2>And We're In!</h2>

<p>Once in, I had to reset my expectations a bit. The gardens consist mostly of flat lawns with trees and bushes and buildings scattered about. Not to mention so much goose poo that it was a struggle to sit down and eat our sandwiches. Ultimately it's more of a park than a garden. I'd expected clever planting to supply riots of colourful flowers even at the tail end of a bad summer but the palette is mostly green and brown throughout . I'd also expected meticulous and dense themed gardens like those at Butchart, which overwhelm the senses with their majesty and detail, each turn revealing endless new delights. But all I found was a couple of rather weak attempts at Alpine and Japanese gardens. I think Kew is hampered by its topology - being on the banks of the Thames it's pretty much entirely flat and there's little artificial landscaping to make it more interesting.</p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>

<p><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/23/kewpagoda.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=678,height=1024,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Kewpagoda" title="Kewpagoda" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/images/2008/09/23/kewpagoda.jpg" width="200" height="302" border="0" style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" /></a></p>

<h2>Glass Houses</h2>

<p>It's just a whole different type of gardens to those that burst with exaggerated splendour from every angle. The best of the plants are kept indoors, under the panes of the still impressively huge old glasshouses. That said, they could do with a lick of paint - there's a whiff of fading grandeur about them and it'd be a shame to see them gradually crumble away for lack of funds or effort. The hot and sweaty palm house and its temperate brother were nice, but lacking a certain something. I've certainly seen better, or maybe I've been spoiled elsewhere. The modern Princess Diana building is huge and has some quality sections (who doesn't like a massive cactus) but you'll have to put the effort in to see it all as the path endlessly diverges and there are several ways in and out. I'd much prefer a single path that leads me neatly through everything there is to see, but then I'm a simple sort. It was more than a little surprising to see a large iguana basking at the edge of the water-lily pond, apparently free to come and go as it pleased with no staff anywhere to be seen. Strange.</p>

<h2>And Now, Your Main Feature...</h2>

<p>I understand that the ten storey pagoda used to be a major feature and it looks striking from a distance, but up close it's really very plain and peeling badly. The new hotness at Kew is the treetop walkway and its small underground atrium, or the "Rhizotron and Xstrata Treetop walkway" to use the proper and more than slightly over the top names. This is the new roller coaster in the theme park that is Kew Gardens, but the only sweat I broke was climbing the stairs. There is a lift, but it's exclusively for the disabled. Except it was broken so they were sat at the bottom not knowing what they were missing. Lucky them.</p>

<p>I've never known something so expensive and so hyped to be so disappointingly dull. [Insert your own gag about the Millennium Dome here, but I never went.] The implementation is clinical but boring - all bare concrete and rusting, sorry 'weathered' steel. You climb the stairs, you walk the loop, looking at some sweet chestnut branches relatively close up and you come back down again. The only information up there is presented via small sculptural metal plaques that convey only about ten words each. Perhaps they didn't want people to stop for long, so they can shepherd everyone through at speed and keep throughput up.</p>

<p>The only point of interest I remember from being up there was that it wobbled more than it looked like it should and the thin flooring flexed worryingly underfoot. In fact I'd stay a good distance away from any 40 stone leviathans that you might encounter up there (might being the operative word - it's a long way up the staircase) lest the whole thing give way. I'm sure it's structurally sound really, but if the majority of my interest is occupied by the feeling of uncertainty beneath my shoes then the whole expensive installation is a bit of a failure.</p>

<div style="clear:both"></div>

<h2>In Summary</h2>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I've griped endlessly here but I had a great day out and I'm glad I went. It's just that it wasn't what I expected and many of the star attractions fell frustratingly short of where they could and should have been. The place is huge and we saw a vast number of different things - many of them quite good, but very few excellent. I'd recommend it, but I'd want to set your expectations first.</p>

<p>This unassuming museum has been nearby all my life, but I've only just visited for the first time on the most recent bank holiday Monday. It's hidden away off a lane near the M25 just South of London Colney, but the brown signage should you get you there as long as you realise the final turn really is into a single track lane seemingly heading off to nowhere. In fact it takes you pretty much through the front gardens of a set of delightful country houses complete with a huge mill pond and then into the small car park for the museum around a tight corner.</p>

<p><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/dehavmosquito.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=532,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Dehavmosquito" title="Dehavmosquito" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/images/2008/09/22/dehavmosquito.jpg" width="400" height="266" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>It's rather hidden away and it doesn't look like there's much at first, beyond a few small and slightly dilapidated buildings. However we were there much longer than we expected - a couple of hours in fact - and were really impressed. The whole museum has an old world charm, partly because of the subject matter and partly because it's clearly the pride and joy of a lot of volunteers who keep it running. There's no slick commercialism here, but there's something much better: a couple of old guys restoring 60 year old wooden warplanes amid thousands of artefacts in various states of disrepair, with some pretty decent labelling and narrative to explain it to you. The old guys will happily explain it to you directly if you engage them.</p>

<p><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/22/dehavcockpit.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=530,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Dehavcockpit" title="Dehavcockpit" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/images/2008/09/22/dehavcockpit.jpg" width="400" height="265" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>I've flown as a passenger in plenty of planes, but only very modern ones. It was particularly interesting to climb into the various old passenger planes to see what a flying traveller used to experience. Answer: great big comfy seats, crystal decanters, but not enough room to stand up and a toilet behind a curtain. The cockpits are quite fascinating too - all wires and pipes and switches. </p>

<p>Overall - a great museum that really impressed. Watch out for opening times though, and figure out where you're going before hand! Check out the <a href="http://www.dehavillandmuseum.co.uk/">De Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre website</a>.</p>

<p>I loved this book. It's a perfectly balanced mix of life story, comedy, irony and occasional sadness all held together with Simmo's long love of cricket. You don't need to be a cricket fanatic to enjoy the book, as that's not what it's really about - it's just the unifying theme. That said it would be the perfect gift for the amateur cricketer in particular!</p>

<div style="float:right; margin-left:20px"><iframe src="http://rcm-uk.amazon.co.uk/e/cm?t=alwthecri-21&o=2&p=8&l=as1&asins=0091897491&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&m=amazon&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr" style="width:120px;height:240px;" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

<p>There are some truly laugh out loud moments and a couple of genuinely touching parts too. Overall the book is a warm and witty autobiography of a slightly awkward everyman that simply focuses on the diverse parts of his life that were cricket related, from infancy up to present day. His other book "What's My Motivation" looks like it promises to do the same but from the point of view of his acting career. If it's as delightful as this one then it should be a real treat, and I intend to pick it up soon!</p>

BODY:
<p>I've been happily beavering away with the stock install of 1.8.6 on Mac OS X 10.5, but it seemed like everyone was moving on to Ruby 1.9 so I thought I'd make the leap. Was it a good idea? More on that later, but first here's how I successfully installed it on my MacBook, based on instructions from <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/2007/02/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx">http://hivelogic.com/articles/2007/02/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx</a>. That page has a good detailed commentary of what's going on, but didn't actually work correctly for me, perhaps because of recent changes to the code in question. My version is short and sweet too, for those that either don't care for the whys and wherefores, or find the command lines self-documenting enough.</p>

<h2>Ruby 1.9 Install Instructions</h2>

<p>Note: following these instructions will install new ruby and irb binaries in /usr/local/bin. The old system versions will still exist in /usr/bin/, but the new ones will take precedence by virtue of the PATH setup noted below.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ensure the following is at end of your ~/.bash_login:
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/mysql/bin:$PATH"</p></li>
<li><p>Reload that modified file so your environment picks it up (or just open a new terminal):<br/>
&gt; source ~/.bash_login</p></li>
<li><p>Download and install libreadline.dylib as follows:<br/>
&gt; curl -O ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/readline-5.1.tar.gz<br/>
&gt; tar xzvf readline-5.1.tar.gz<br/>
&gt; cd readline-5.1<br/>
&gt; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local<br/>
&gt; make CPPFLAGS=-DNEED_EXTERN_PC SHOBJ_LDFLAGS=-dynamiclib<br/>
&gt; sudo make install</p></li>
<li><p>Download and install latest Ruby 1.9 (or instead of living on the bleeding edge, download a tar of a stable source tree from <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/</a> in place of the first step below):<br/>
&gt; svn co http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/trunk ruby&#95;trunk<br/>
&gt; cd ruby&#95;trunk<br/>
&gt; autoconf<br/>
&gt; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-pthread --with-readline-dir=/usr/local --enable-shared<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; sudo make install<br/></p></li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! Now assuming your PATH is setup as above, ruby --version should report 1.9. If not, check that 'which ruby' reports /usr/local/bin/ruby.</p>

<h2>So What Next?</h2>

<p>What next indeed! I thought I'd try and run a simple ruby app of mine to see if it worked. It didn't, but that's because the new ruby install keeps its gems in a different location and its cupboard was bare. I set out to reinstall the gems I needed, but I ran into some problems. Some gems just won't install, because they have C extensions that are incompatible with Ruby 1.9 so they fail to compile during gem install. Others installed fine but then failed at runtime due to Ruby compatibility issues. There's a great page with the major porting tips at <a href="http://boga.wordpress.com/2008/04/15/ruby-19-porting-notes/">http://boga.wordpress.com/2008/04/15/ruby-19-porting-notes/</a> which helped me fix most of the Ruby issues. Here's a breakdown of my struggles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ramaze worked great as it's been 1.9 compatible for ages.</li>
<li>The mysql gem only installed successfully by downloading the 2.8pre4 code from <a href="http://tmtm.org/downloads/mysql/ruby/">http://tmtm.org/downloads/mysql/ruby/</a> and following the install instructions.</li>
<li>The tens of gems that constitute DataMapper (my current ORM of choice) struggled. I was able to make simple Ruby changes to fix many bits, but I ran into real issues getting the database adapter gems do_mysql and do_sqlite3 to install as their C extensions are incompatible.</li>
<li>I don't think my own code ever really got to run, so I have no idea if it's good or not. I suspect it's fine or requires minimal Ruby mods.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I ran out of time and gave up as I've never gotten into the C extension side of things before and didn't fancy starting. Perhaps I'd be able to sort it out if I put the time and effort in.</p>

<p>Overall it's shown me that Ruby 1.9 is only worth the effort if all the gems you require are already compatible. I kind of already knew that before I embarked on this mission, but hoped that I'd be pleasantly surprised, or be able to do the porting myself with minimal effort. I was a bit disappointed to find things lagging behind as I assumed the Ruby community were eager technologists always at the forefront of each new thing! Maybe people are too busy coding solutions to their real world problems to bother with 1.9 until it's declared official (late 2008 at last mention). I also get the impression they've become jaded with the extremely long gestation period for this release. Maybe I'll try 1.8.7. One step at a time.</p>

No, I haven't tried since. I've been sticking with 1.8.6 or 1.8.7 (which is definitely worth the upgrade in general, for less bugs, a few 1.9 features and slightly better speed).

<p>Because Ruby is capable, quick to write, quick to get running and a joy to use!</p>

<p>I've got a reasonably long and varied history of programming in many languages, and not just mainstream ones, but I'm mostly looking at Java and its ilk as my point of comparison here. So, here's why Ruby is often a superior choice for me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>At least one .rb file and a Ruby interpreter is all you need. Edit code then run immediately. No compilation into class files then building into a jar/war/ear. But no biggie you say, my IDE hides all that building and I just edit then run with my Java code. Sure, but once your application gets big that build step is still a non-zero hit: for a big Java web app it might take a minute or more to build the eventual ear.</p></li>
<li><p>And then there's the two minutes waiting for your Java web app to deploy as JBoss (or Java EE app server of your choice) grinds into action. Finally, three minutes after you edited the code you're able to see the results in the browser! I use Ramaze for my Ruby web apps, which starts up in seconds, even for a big app. But more importantly, it reloads modified files at runtime so I don't have to re-deploy to see the results of my actions. Zero wait between edit and test. The difference this makes when you're hammering away at a problem is colossal.</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby is neat as a language, generally requiring less code to solve any given problem whilst still being readable. For a start, an endless procession of Java getters and setters can be replaced with <code>attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :title</code>. And that's just one trivial example of Ruby goodness.</p></li>
<li><p>Ruby is a joy to use. This may be the single most important point here. If you've got to use it all day, you'll be far more productive if you're happy about it. When you lose track of time because you're engrossed in what you're doing, and making speedy progress too, you're onto a winner.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Ruby's not perfect (if you think you've found the perfect programming language I've got a bridge you might want to buy) but it's a relatively young language and improving quickly right now. For me it's way up there as the best available compromise for many types of projects. If nothing else, it's been the single most interesting and enjoyable language to learn, having dealt with many others before. If you're interested in learning Ruby, take a look at <a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/2008/09/book-review-the.html">my review of The Ruby Programming Language</a> - a very decent book to explain it all to you.</p>

BODY:
<p>This definitive tome came out at just the right time for me, as I was looking to buy a Ruby reference, and this was bang up to date for 1.8.6 and 1.9 and co-written by Matz himself, along with David Flanagan. Yukihiro 'Matz' Matsumoto is the main man behind Ruby, so he ought to know what's what.</p>

<p>I was initially surprised to find that the book didn't conform to the '..in a Nutshell' style of programming language reference book with which I'm most familiar. It doesn't comprise endless chapters of API reference laid out in a stiffly templated fashion - it is much more prosaic, using the vast majority of its pages to explain Ruby's syntax and workings in a narrative manner with lashings of ad hoc examples. On reflection this makes sense as Ruby is a multi-faceted beast with much intrigue lying in its extensive syntax and dynamic nature. Hence a lot of attention is paid to the manner in which it is loaded and interpreted at run time, a full understanding of which is vital to being a great Ruby programmer.</p>

<p>There are some chapters at the end which deal with some of the basic API stuff (String, Array, Hash etc.) but these take the form of commentary and neat examples to demonstrate each method available in a compact but complete manner.</p>

<p>Overall I found it to be well written and a joy to read. I didn't skip the bits I thought I knew and came away much the wiser for it. I've pretty much read it cover to cover, as well as using it to look things up when I wasn't sure - and I'd recommend anyone else do the same.</p>

<p>The only slight let-down is the much hyped chapter head drawings by why the lucky stiff, the unusually named Ruby guru, celebrity and wacky artist. I can't help feel that they were included so as to be able to put his name on the cover. I also suspect that the publishers have let why down rather badly with their handling of his artwork - reproducing his pencil drawings extremely unsympathetically. If that's all I can find to complain about though, it must be a pretty decent book, and it certainly is. Buy one today!</p>

BODY:
<p>I went to Cheddar Gorge at the weekend on the way back from deepest, cideriest Somerset. Saw the brown signage away from the M5 and thought, hey why not! I didn't have any major expectations, having not been there before, but I was hopeful of finding a huge fissure, carved into cheesy yellow crags with rivulets of Worcestershire sauce running down the walls.</p>

<p><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/09/cheddargorge.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=530,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Cheddargorge" title="Cheddargorge" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/images/2008/09/09/cheddargorge.jpg" width="200" height="132" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>So it turns out the gorge is made of rocks and mud and plants and goats and suchlike. Even more distressingly it's filled with a road and the endless car parks at that road's edge. Still, seeing as I needed somewhere to park, I can hardly complain. Having done so myself and the missus wandered on foot up the gorge, to find the touristy spectacles that did await. But after seeing nothing but more car parking we turned round and headed down instead. We found the old and more than slightly cheesy village of Cheddar, with its grotty mix of olde worlde cheese shoppes and nasty 60s concrete cave / museum entrances. We paid £15 for an Explorer ticket that enables us to do everything there is to do in Cheddar and its gorge at any time over the next ten years! We only managed Gough's Cave and the tour bus since we were pushed for time, but they represented acceptable value for money.</p>

<p>Gough's cave is the bigger of the two cavey attractions, and it slags off Cox's Cave as being relatively unimpressive so we didn't bother with that one. It took us an hour or so to go through the quite extensive network of passages and chambers, with large orange audio-guide handsets clamped to our ears for the well pitched talky tour. Staff were helpful too and even turned all the lights off in one of the chambers for our amusement and edification. You'll have to go in there yourself to find what wonders await, but here's just a single picture to whet your appetite.</p>

<p><a href="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/09/goughcave.jpg" onclick="window.open(this.href, '_blank', 'width=800,height=529,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img alt="Goughcave" title="Goughcave" src="http://alwaysthecritic.typepad.com/atc/images/2008/09/09/goughcave.jpg" width="200" height="132" border="0"  /></a></p>

<p>The tour bus took some finding as the map on the leaflet is near useless and simply says "by the lake". Turns out that means the bottom-most of at least three lakes strung through the village. Once aboard and up to the top deck it's a quick 15 minute ride back up the gorge (past our parked car) with a decent guide on board explaining everything and pointing out all the stuff I'd missed in my earlier foray.</p>

<p>It's not exactly the Grand Canyon but overall it's a nice day out. We went on a Monday so it wasn't very busy. It's probably hellish when it's swarming.</p>

BODY:
<p>Every day I notice examples of infuriatingly bad design, often in places where it simply boggles the mind. Cash machines for example. Around for decades now and used by millions of people every day you'd think they would have evolved into the ultimate example of efficient usability. Yet many of them seem to have been created and installed without even the slightest common sense being brought into the equation.</p>

<p>As a person of about average height, when I stand in front of a cash machine I am convinced of man's inhumanity to man as all I can see is the brickwork in front of my face. I contort myself into an undignified squat with my arse sticking out, in order to be able to see the machine. This makes it that much harder to conceal my actions with my body. Even in this position, the angle and deep inset of the screen is such that the buttons along the edge are visually misaligned so that they appear to match up with the option below the one I intend. Some banks solve this parallax error with lines running from the buttons to the plane of the screen. Hooray for them! They've probably got a patent on this bit of common sense to prevent the rest of the world from benefiting. Boo to them!</p>

<p>I appreciate that short and disabled people must be accommodated, but I struggle to believe that there's no decent solution that doesn't wreck the experience for the other 90%. Do those responsible possess enough awareness of the world around them to realise their folly once they have committed it? Presumably not otherwise they'd fix it the next time and we'd have had decent cash machines since about 1975. So, I offer my services as a "common sense consultant", ready to look on any problem with eyes wide open and a big dollop of common sense and competency. And thus will the world become a nicer place and I will become rich. But alas, I may have to consider that Plan B.</p>

BODY:
<p>I went to see <a href="http://www.fatpigtheplay.com/">Fat Pig</a> at The Trafalgar Studios a week ago. Fat Pig is a comedy play by Neil LaBute, starring (when I saw it) Kris Marshall, Robert Webb, Joanna Page and Ella Smith. In fact that's the entire cast, so they must each be doing OK out of the rather exorbitant ticket price! I understand the run's been extended but a couple of new cast members will be in place soonish, including Kelly Brook.</p>

<p>The venue's quite neat, though if you're at the front you may feel uncomfortably close to the action: being a 'studio' there's no raised stage. If you're at the back you may struggle with vertigo: the seating comprises a single very steeply raked tier. The cast do their thing, generally two at a time, on the two sided revolving set, which is neatly employed though not nearly as clever as I've become used to on the London stage. Maybe a bit more effort could have been put into creative use of lighting to jazz up the set and establish mood more effectively.</p>

<p>It took me a minute to confirm it to myself, but it soon became apparent that the entire cast were putting on American accents. Indeed the whole thing is apparently set in some US metropolis or other - presumably New York or LA. But it could quite easily have been UKified with no loss of plot or character cohesion, and that would have removed the nagging distraction that bugged me throughout. It's a shame that this is what I remember most about the play!</p>

<p>The other things that stick most boldly in the mind are a mix of good and bad. The cast are very good, though I'd stop short of saying excellent. Kris Marshall gets the most comicly promising character and fills it out flamboyantly, as does Joanna Page in the other 'support' role. There are a fair few laughs to be had, but not as many or as deep as the flyers would have you believe. The two main protagonists are lumbered with carrying the plot however, and seem to spend most of their time delivering endless small talk and lovers' ramblings - which would be fine if it was full of sparkling comedy dialogue. But it wasn't. The end was particularly disappointing, as the play simply runs out of steam after another tortuously long heart to heart devoid of laughs. The audience weren't even sure whether it had ended or not.</p>

<p>It's easy to pick fault, and I'll freely admit I've not seen much non-musical theatre recently. Maybe I've been spoiled with the cavalcade of hilarity and slick production that was Spamalot and Avenue Q. Maybe I'm a philistine. Maybe Fat Pig was just so so and only managing to elevate itself by virtue of a good cast and some decent marketing. I'll give it one thing - it tickled my brain buds and left me thinking about it even a week later.  </p>
